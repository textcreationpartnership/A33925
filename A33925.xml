            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:40486:2"/>
            <head>THE PREFACE, OR, EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THis Treatiſe is deſigned for thy ſpecial and ſpiritual Profit; its true that the holy Scripture, commonly called the Bible, is the Book of all Books, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, we all ought to ſpeak, write and walk; and its true as the Wiſe man ſaith, of making many
<pb facs="tcp:40486:3"/> Books there is no end, eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our end therein be the glory of God, and the good of Souls: its true we know but in part, and a very little, little part too, and therefore can Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy but in part.</p>
            <p>Therefore read not any mans Book but with a ſuppoſition, that there may be a mixture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſome Errour with Truth, and ſome miſtakes, and receive nothing for truth from the word or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Perſon who ever it be, but as its rightly grounded on the Word of God, the Scripture of Truth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which all ought to ſpeak, and the beſt of men may be in ſome things miſtaken; though ordinarily in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial things of the New-Birth of Faith and Holineſs, the Spirits work is the ſame in all, yet by reaſon of the Babyloniſh confuſion that yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, the language of the Saints
<pb facs="tcp:40486:3"/> ſeems to be much divided; in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof, I thought nothing more likely to produce unity in ſpirit, then unity in the body and ſubſtance of Truth; for which cauſe I have made this Eſſay in bringing forth this brief plain Treatiſe about the most ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial matters of Christianity, that all who agree in the ſubſtance of Truth, may unite in Spirit; and although we cannot attain ſuch a uniting as is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ſhall in time be by the Lord accompliſhed, in and amongſt his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to that Propheſie and Promiſe, <hi>Zeph. 3. 9.</hi> Yet it is my hearts deſire, that all who truly love the Lord, would ſhew it by their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at leaſt in affection, for that is Goſpel-Grace and Love indeed, to love for God and Chriſts ſake, though of differing apprehenſions about ſome of the weighty things in the New-Covenant,
<pb facs="tcp:40486:4"/> for every Truth of Chriſt is of weight and worth, and is, or ought ſo to be eſteemed by all that love him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 127, 128. and the right underſtanding of the mind of God in the Scripture, is the only wright way of uniting.</p>
            <p>I am far from the mind of thoſe who pretend and endeavour the uniting of all into uniformity in Faith and Worſhip, by Coerſive Power and human force; a unity more ſuiting Brutes then Chriſtians, and a way to build up Satans Kingdom, under pretence of the Kingdom of Chriſt; but that I earnestly long after, and pray for, is, the uniting of all true Chriſtians in the ſpirit and faith of the Goſpel, who are the Church and Kingdom of Chriſt, his Body Miſtical, and if through darkneſs we cannot attain the unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Chriſtian Faith, and worſhip
<pb facs="tcp:40486:4"/> in every part, but the language of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be yet divided, yet let every one endeavour the attainment of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love, and forbearance each to other, not Judging, Senſuring, and Reviling, which ſhews the ſpirit of the World, and not of Christ.</p>
            <p>And theſe enſuing Chapters are moſt eſpecially and principally direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch, who alone are capacitated to Understand, Believe and Practiſe the things in them contained, they are not the Notions of ſudden Conception, but the fruit and birth of many years Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and Meditation, and I hope it may, through the Bleſſing of God, at ſome time or other, to ſome perſons or other, add ſomething or other to the Understanding, Faith, Hope, and Joy of their Souls, and be ſome help of direction to a right walk in the way of Life.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40486:5"/>
            <p>I ſhall not ſay any thing as to the matters handled in this Treatiſe, by way of Commendation, to induce the Reader to its Peruſal; if it ſpeak not for it ſelf, in the uſe thereof, the Reader is at liberty to lay it aſide, only let him beware that he ſlight it not, becauſe it is not ſuited to his mind; if it be according to the Divine revelation of the Word and Will of Chriſt; its the great concernment of all that will approve themſelves grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before the Lord, to bring their minds to the Scripture, and not the Scripture to their minds; it is to be feared that great hath been the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of Chriſtians in this very thing at this day, open-heartedneſs to God-ward, and a ſincere will to know that we may do the will of the Lord, is the ready way to know more of his will, and then ſhall we not be aſhamed,
<pb facs="tcp:40486:5"/> when we have a reſpect to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; ignorance of any part of the Revealed Will of God is a ſin, a ſinful defect in gratious perſons, but to be willingly ignorant, or willfully diſobedient to any part of the Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will of God, is a ſin of the higheſt nature, and muſt be puniſhed with many ſtripes, <hi>Luk. 12. 47, 48.</hi> will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to add to, or diminiſh from the Word of God, is a ſin, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch is declared in the Word, <hi>Deut. 4. 2. Prov. 30. 6. Rev. 22. 18, 19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, I do believe that ſincere deſires, accompanied with the like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, after the knowledge of the will of Chriſt, and a faithful living up to what we know, reſolving our wiſdom and wills in every thing into the wiſdom and will of Chriſt, would be wonderfully bleſt of the Lord for
<pb facs="tcp:40486:6"/> ſpiritual grouth, and uniting of the Saints both in faith and worſhip.</p>
            <p>I have herein declared my Faith in which I live, and believe that by the grace of God I ſhall die, and yet live Eternally: This have I declared as the diſcovery of my heart in the matters of my God, when I am gone hence, and ſhall be hear no more ſeen.</p>
            <p>And what ever may be found in any other of my Writing that may ſeem contrary to any thing in this, or is contrary in very de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it by this, or elſe let it fall to the ground, for days of Temptation oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brings forth effects, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions after Repentance.</p>
            <p>To be ſound in the Faith, and in the Principles of Religion, is of deep concernment to all Chriſtians, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a good and Chriſtian walk in the
<pb facs="tcp:40486:6"/> way of ſincere and univerſal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obedience, is that which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerneth and becometh Chriſtians, in order to their eternal Welfare.</p>
            <p>As a help to both have I preſented this ſmall brief Treatiſe to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, in which I have to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my ability and light, not only ſtudied Truth, that might be profiting to the Reader, but brevity likewiſe, that much might be found in a little Volume, in which, if perſons exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their own underſtandings in the uſe thereof, they may probably reap ſome benefit thereby. And Reader, what thee doſt find differing from thine own underſtanding, be not haſty in judging or ſenſuring, but read and ponder, and ſearch the Scripture, to ſee whether it be ſo or no, without which the moſt do wrong to the Truth, and to thine own ſoul.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40486:7"/>
            <p>But I ſhall ſay no more, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the Readers, in the bleſſing of God, praying for their profiting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and if your ſouls do reap any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefit or advantage in the uſe hereof, let God have the Glory, and the Author (as Inſtrument) hath his end anſwered; And ſo fare the well in the Lord: Grace, Mercy, Peace and Truth, be with all that love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40486:29"/> us; becauſe <hi>he is the Way, the Truth and the Life,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. If our Teaching be of the Spirit of Chriſt, it opens Jeſus Chriſt unto us, and the Myſtery of the Love of God in him, the Pardon, Peace, the Life and Salvation which is in him, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 12. Now we have received not the Spirit which is of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God:</hi> but falſe Spirits ſpeak of themſelves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themſelves, and in ſomething or other deſignedly derogates from Chriſt, and the Salvation that is by him.</p>
               <p>In this Anſwer note theſe two things: 1. In that he ſpeaks not of himſelf, but ſhews <hi>us the things of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> things to come, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Salvation to come, <hi>that is to be obtained by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with eternal Glory:</hi> it is ſo far from proving him not to be of God, that it indeed proves him to be God, and one in the ſame Work with the Father and the Son, to exalt the Son as the Father hath.</p>
               <p>And 2ly. That he is in this, by our Lord, clearly diſcovered to us in way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from all falſe Spirits, who exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not the Son of God, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Hearing in it ſelf is no argument to prove the Spirit not to be God; for God in Scriprure is frequently ſaid to hear, <hi>Pſ. 65. 2. Jer.</hi> 8. 6.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40486:30"/> ſo that the Spirits Interceſſion for us, or in and by us, is by helping our infirmities both in matter and manner, according to the Will of God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. Chriſt our Mediator is our Interceſſor for us, and the holy Spirit is our Interceſſor in and by us, helping and aſſiſting us to pray for ſuch things as we need, and in ſuch a manner as we ought, ſo that all thoſe Titles given to the Spirit in the Scripture, and thoſe Works aſcribed to him relating to his Office and Work in the God-head, no whit derogates from his Union in the ſame Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or eternal Exiſtency in and with the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>That there is any perſonality in God, or three Perſons in the Divine Eſſence is a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage I do not yet underſtand, is made uſe of in the Scriptures; therefore I avoid the terms, though I am not willing to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or doubt, but that thoſe who uſe it (who are godly, and underſtand what they ſay) do it thereby to expreſs the Truth of the Scripture-diſtinction in the Trinity, <hi>i. e.</hi> that there is Father, Son and Spirit in unity of Nature, and is but one God, the word <hi>Perſon</hi> being not at all, as I know, given either to the Father or holy Spirit, but to the Son, as God and Man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.<note place="margin">The truth of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Old Teſtament</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this Truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> a plurality in one infinite and eternal God is clearly to be proved from the Old Teſtament, even
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40486:31"/> from the Creation, and that probably in more clear and God-like Terms of Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than Perſons, which probably the Learned have avoided for ſome (at leaſt ſuppoſed) good Reaſons, on which account I ſhall at preſent ſay no more, onely preſent to thoſe that underſtand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>The ſum of all is this, That God is One, Eternal, Infinite, Subſtantial Being, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into Father, Son and holy Spirit, and in all there are Divine and Diſtinct Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Properties and Operations, yet in all no one wills, no one acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the other, <hi>Gen. 1. 1, 2, 26.

               <p>Nor 7thly, Was it the Word of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites or ſelf-righteous Perſons, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns Hypocrites with a witneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. throughout, and 24. 51. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 44. and for ſelf-righteous Perſons, who think to be ſaved by their own works, it ſhuts them out both of the Grace and Glory thereof, <hi>Mat. 5. 20.

               <p>So that our Lord having before us owned the Scriptures and fulfilled them, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and commanded them, I ſay, That if we believe that He was the Chriſt, and not a Deceiver, which is blaſphemy to think, we need no further proof of the Truth of the Scripture.

So it was in his calling <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his Country and the Affliction of his Seed four hundred years, it was all in order to their poſſeſſion of the promiſed Land, which was the crowning Work at laſt, and all before was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to it: ſo in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Reſtauration by Jeſus Chriſt, in all the parts of it, the laſt will be the perfecting and crowning Work: ſo in the Saints ſpiritual Race and Warfare,

Pſal.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>2. In that he took time to conſult about making man, more than in all the reſt of the Creation; the reſt of the Creation was made ſuddenly, he ſpake the Word, and it was done; and much was done by Divine Ordinance, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 20, 21. but when he comes to make Man, he deliberates upon it, an there ſeems to be (as it were) a Conſultation of the whole Trinity, <hi>Let us make Man,</hi> which he did not of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Creation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sometimes Soul intendeth the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40486:48"/> whole Man, Body and Soul, as hath been already proved; ſometimes the word Soul intends both Soul and Spirit onely, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. ſometimes the word Spirit intends both Soul and Spirit, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 1 But when it is diſtinguiſhed as in that Scripture before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and in ſome others likewiſe in the three-fold diſtinction; I underſtand the Difference and Diſtinction to conſiſt in this:</p>
               <p>1. As in all men, the Spirit I underſtand to be that Reaſon, Wiſdom, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Conſcience, Will and Affections, wherein conſiſteth moſt eſpecially the Image of God, the moſt pure part of the Soul, and this is that which is called the Spirit of Man, in diſtinction from the Soul; and this is in all men, though exceedingly defaced by the Fall.</p>
               <p>And in as much as there muſt be Animal Spirits, Vigitation, Sence, Luſtings, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Thirſt, &amp;c. that is called Soul in other Creatures, and this lieth and liveth in the whole Body, and is the Life and Animation thereof; and this I underſtand is intended by Soul, when diſtinguiſhed from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. In a word, to be plain, what is in man as to Life, and Sence, and Motion, as in other Creatures, that is the Soul; what is in man above and beyond other Creatures, wherein his Excellency conſiſteth as Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that is the Spirit; and this is the Spirit in all men.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That Pride was the cauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Fall and Condemnation, or that by which he became a Devil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That very probably the fallen Angels ſtood but a little while; they fell in the young eſtate of their Creation, while No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Novices in Faith or Miniſtry
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40486:59"/> are in greateſt danger to be inſnared with the Devils ſin of Pride. And</p>
               <p n="4">4. That ſuch is the evil of the ſin of Pride, that it expoſes thoſe that are inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therewith, and captivated thereby, to the Devils Condemnation that is eternal, without hope or help: O therefore take heed and beware of Pride.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture-Ground is, the temptation he made uſe of, and prevailed upon our firſt Parents withal; which was, Pride and Diſobedience, <hi>he knoweth ye ſhall be as Gods,</hi> &amp;c. It ſeems he knew by experience what aſpiring Pride would do, and ſo prevails to throw down Man (as he thought) into his own condemnation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſin of Satan was Lying, as deſcribed by our Lord, <hi>Joh. 8. 44. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not in the Truth,</hi> but turned from the Truth to his own Lies; <hi>for when he ſpeaketh a Ly he speaketh of his own,</hi> i. e. his own Nature, and his own Sin; <hi>for he is a Lyar, and the Father thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thirdly, to Pride and Lying Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience muſt be added: I may ſay truly, that Pride and Lying is Diſobedience it ſelf, and that all known Diſobedience car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Pride and Lying in it: Pride is the cauſe why Men will not obey, when they know, what they promiſe themſelves in Diſobedience proves a Ly.</p>
               <p>I am not of the mind as ſome are: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1. That in their firſt Creation they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40486:60"/> were ſet to miniſter for Mans Good; and their thinking that too mean, was the cauſe of their Fall: and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe (as I have before minded) that very probably their Creation and Fall too was before Man was made.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe that Man in his created eſtate of Innocency had no need of Angels to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The World then was not put in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection under Angels till after the Fall, but Man was the ſole Lord thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under his Maker; nor ſhall it be in ſubiection to them after Reſtauration, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor was it likely, that they ſhould be aſſiſting him on the ſpiritual account, to keep him from ſin; for then he had not been left to his free will, in his created e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, to ſtand or fall</p>
               <p>Nor 2. do I think their Sin was againſt the holy Spirit, as ſome ſuppoſe, according to the Senſe thereof in Scripture, as it is the unpardonable Sin; (<hi>i. e.</hi> in their Fall) becauſe they were created upright and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creatures, as Man was; and was no more capable to ſin that Sin than Man was; though all Sin ever was, and is againſt the holy Spirit, though not in the Senſe as the unpardonable Sin is: they having nothing to provoke them to ſin on the one hand, ſo nothing to prompt them to conſtancy in Humility and Obedience on the other hand, but their good created eſtate, and the

               <p>And his active Obedience, in the fulneſs and perfection thereof, was his perfect Holineſs, by which he was fitted to offer up himſelf to God an acceptable Sacrifice for ſinners, which perfect Obedience and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in him as our Head, is become the Believers by imputation, and ſo his active Obedience is the Believers Sanctification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> in the Sufferings of Chriſt, lay more in the Excellency of the Perſon ſuffering, than in the Greatneſs of the things ſuffered, though
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40486:68"/> the ſufferings were exceeding great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born by an infinite Perſon; it was the infinite Worth of the Perſon that ſuffered, that ſet an infinite value on the Suffering, more than if all the World had ſuffered to eternity, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 18, 19.</p>
               <p>2. Had it been for the redemption but of one perſon, it muſt have been with the ſame price; ſo that Satisfaction for the Sins of the World no whit augmented the price paid; therefore no abſurdity at all.</p>
               <p>3. No perſon is delivered only and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply on the ſufferings of Chriſt, but the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that God took in the ſufferings of Chriſt was on terms of their believing and obeying the Goſpel; and on theſe terms it is, that the Grace of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is publiſhed to all, and none are like to partake thereof without Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Obedience, though not as the meritorious cauſe, yet as the terms on which it is diſpenced, <hi>Mar. 16. 16. Luke</hi> 24. 47. though, it's true, Repentance effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted is the gift of Grace.</p>
               <p>4. VVere it not ſo, the Plaiſter would not be as large as the VVound, nor the Phyſicians hand be as large in the Cure, as the Deſtroyer was to deſtroy, which ſeems not only diſhonourable to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of Chriſt, but contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. to 20. though all partake not of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40486:68"/> benefits, the fault is in themſelves, and not in the Phyſician, <hi>Hoſea 13. 9. 2 Peter</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <p>5. Yet God had a ſpecial reſpect in this great tranſaction of the Suffering of his Son, unto his elect, whom he foreknew, and predeſtinated them to be partakers of the Benefits thereof, <hi>Rom. 8. 2, 3, Heb, 2. 10. Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p>6. And finally, the manner and method of Gods work, both in the Creation of Man and ſince the Fall, was</p>
               <p n="1">1. He made Man upright in his own Image, and ſo left him in that good created eſtate, to his own power and will to ſtand or fall: God did not act to forward his Fall, nor yet to hinder it, more than give his Law of Command, with the Threat on Diſobedience; but he ſinned voluntarily, by the temptation offered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Man being fallen from God, he hath provided a Remedy, a bleſſed way of Recovery; and this Remedy is as large as the caſe requireth, and is to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and tendred to all, (and that truly too) on the terms thereof; that is, Faith, Repentance and ſincere Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that now whoever will, may come and take of <hi>this Water of Life freely;</hi> and Man is left free to accept or not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; and ſo mans Deſtruction will be (the ſecond time) of himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:40486:69"/>
               <p>God hath not bound himſelf, nor is he tyed in Juſtice to work men to the terms preſcribed, nor doth he any thing to hinder, but very much the contrary, not only in the All-ſufficiency of the Means, but by the publiſhing thereof, and manifold mercies, and invitations to Repentance.</p>
               <p>VVhat he affords of ſpecial Grace and Aſſiſtance to any, is his ſuperabounding Mercy, and it no whit derogates from from his general Love, Kindneſs and Proviſion for mankind in general: and it is mans wilful wickedneſs, in chooſing Death rather than Life, and thereby judge themſelves unworthy of the Life that is offered to them.</p>
               <p>It is true, God foreſaw Man in his fallen ſtate; and ſaw, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Greatneſs of the Grace of his New Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet that none would of themſelves ſeek after God, and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleave unto him in that New and Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings way, on which he did determine; and it was the Covenant, and Contract between the Father and the Son, (in this great Undertaking, that his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring might not be in vain) to bring in ſome Souls effectually into the Grace of the Covenant, and that not from any natural good in them more than others, but without all reſpect of perſons, only his ſpecial and ſuperabounding Grace;

               <p>THe deſign of God by Jeſus Chriſt in his New Covenant-work, was, <hi>to make all things New,</hi> Rev. 21. 5. <hi>And he that ſate upon the Throne, ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I make all things New,</hi> &amp;c. God made the firſt, or old World, both Heavens and Earth, and all things therein for the uſe of man, and then made man to poſſeſs it; but man fell by ſin, and the whole Creation fell with him, as a juſt Judgment of God upon man for his ſin, <hi>Gen. 3. 17. Job</hi> 15. 15. Now in as much as this old Creation was loſt and faln, the deſign of God by Jeſus Chriſt was the recovery and reſtauration of all again, and to make all New, not of new matter that was not before, but to make the Old New again; all <hi>Old things muſt be made New.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is it that God deſigned by</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What will God make new. A new People.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt to make New?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A new people, brought out from the old ſtock; a people renewed by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40486:70"/> the power and ſpirit of Grace, by and through the Goſpel; and this is that which is owned of all the godly, witneſſed in the Scriptures, and in a meaſure experienced by all the Saints, 2 <hi>Cor. 15. 17. If any man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature, Old things are paſt away, behold all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come New,</hi> Eph. 4. 23, 24. <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind; and that ye put on the New Man, which after God, is Created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> and this is that birth which is from above, <hi>without which, no man can ſee the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Joh. 3. 3.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>This is effected here in the Kingdome of Grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, It is ſo, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings thereof, in order to its perfection in the Kingdom of glory; for it will not be perfected till the Reſurrection of the body from the dead, that is called <hi>the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> Rom. 8. 23. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected already in Chriſt our head, the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Adam, <hi>who was the Lord from Heaven;</hi> but it muſt have its time of perfecting in the members, begun here, and perfected in the day of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10. then it is, that <hi>our vile bodies ſhall be changed and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned like unto his glorious Body,</hi> Phil. 3. 21. <hi>Then the whole man ſhall come forth compleat in the Heavenly Birth.</hi>

Heb.</hi> 8. 8. 13. &amp; 12. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> This Covenant is ſaid to be made, and to be of force from the death of the Teſtator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> True, it is ſo, it took its effect then, and virtually from the Fall; from the firſt Promiſe, <hi>that the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head;</hi> ſo that all the Saints ſince the Fall, were renewed and ſanctified by virtue of this Covenant, which became the alone miniſtration of God to men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the Teſtator, in, and with whom the Covenant was made, and that before the world was, 2 <hi>Tim. 4 9. Tit.</hi> 1. 2. ſo that it hath had its effect virtually from the beginning, as a preparation to glory, but it is indeed the Covenant of the glorious Eſtate.</p>
               <p>3. And in this New Covenant is brought<note place="margin">3 A new Law.</note> forth a new Law, for this new People, the Law of Faith, and the Law of Love, <hi>Joh. 13. 34. A new Commandement give I unto you, that ye love one another,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> This was the Old Commandement, and from the beginning, the Sum of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40486:71"/> whole Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy might, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, as the Law, it did require it, as imployed in it, but if any anſwered it, it was by the Grace of the New Covenant, though the duty of the Old; but now its the duty of the New Covenant, ſeated on the new terms of the Goſpel, from the grace thereof, from the love of Chriſt, and effected thereby, <hi>Rom. 5. 5. The love of Chriſt is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Spirit that he hath given to us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 19. We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt: its therefore new, becauſe in all the Saints its not only required, but <hi>is true both in him, (i. e.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>and in you,</hi> i. e. the Saints; and this is that which is, and ſhall be, the great Law of the perfect and glorious Eſtate, in the new world, and that to Eternity.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40486:72"/> there is no other promiſe thereof in the terms expreſt, in the Old Teſtament. 2. That it is to be underſtood literally, and not myſtically, or ſpiritually, that is a wrong to the Scripture; for it is the material viſible Heavens and Earth that <hi>Peter</hi> treateth of, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7. its the ſame that muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and this is that which is frequently called in Scripture, the World, or Earth to come, <hi>Mat. 12. 32. Luk. 2. 35. Heb.</hi> 2. 5. the world, of which the Saints by Faith, are made Heirs, <hi>Rom. 4. 13. For the Promiſe that</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhould be the Heir of the world, was not to</hi> Abraham, <hi>or his Seed through the Law, but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> and this cannot be underſtood that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that all Believers ſhould be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Children (though that be a truth, and is expreſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) and that for two reaſons: 1. It's improper ſo to underſtand it, for ſo believers are rather his Heirs, his Children, and not he their Heir, for in this he is to be Heir of the world. 2. Becauſe in this Heir-ſhip of <hi>Abraham</hi> to the world, his Children are Heirs to the ſame Promiſe with him, <hi>the Promiſe is to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace, that the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed.</hi> What Promiſe? to be the <hi>Heirs of the world:</hi> this is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that our Fathers were ſeeking after, and dyed in the Faith thereof, <hi>Heb. 11. 13, 14, 15. Wherefore God hath prepared for them a

It was the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of God, in ſending Chriſt into the World; and of Chriſt in coming into the World, to do that for the World, without which, this new Work and World could not be accompliſhed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 40. And in order to the accompliſhing hereof, he is aſcended up where he was before, to prepare a place for his People, <hi>John</hi> 14. 2, 3. and to prepare a people for that place, <hi>Heb. 12. 2. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 5.

               <p>Object. <hi>It's frequently ſaid in Scripture, that the Reward of the Saints is in Heaven,</hi> That it's laid up in Heaven for them, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true: it is ſo, and that without any Contradiction at all to this preſent Truth, which is ſo apparantly held forth in Scripture. It behoves us ſo to Underſtand one Truth, as not to loſe, or deſtroy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which hath been a great Weakneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians. But let us ſee a little how both may ſtand together; the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints may be ſaid to be in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40486:74"/> Heaven, and to be <hi>reſerved in Heaven for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As all the good Gifts of God given to the Saints, on the Goſpel account, now in this day of Grace, in order to that Glory, are ſaid (in ſence and ſubſtance) to be in Heaven; for our Heavenly Birth muſt be from thence, <hi>John 3. 3. Except a man be born again above</hi> (ſo the Word is) <hi>he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Kingdom of Heaven. Jeruſalem which is above, is the Mother of us all, and every good and perfect Gift cometh down from the Father of Lights,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Glory of that Eſtate is adminiſtred here below, by the Word and Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 12. But the Glory it ſelf is reſerved in Heaven, till the time appointed, and then the Glory ſhall be adminiſtred down from thence, as now the Grace, and gracious Gifts are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We Read in Scripture, that <hi>New Jeruſalem muſt come down from God out of Heaven, and the Tabernacle of God will be with them,</hi> Rom. 21. 23. So that it may very well ſtand together, that it is in Heaven, and yet ſhall come down into the New Earth.</p>
               <p>No wonder, if that State and Glory of the Saints is called Heaven then, when in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the New earth, and New ſtate of the Church in it's imperfection, in this ſide that Glory (becauſe made partakers of ſome of the Virtues of Grace) is called <hi>Heaven;</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 13. 31,

               <p>FAith is an excellent Divine Virtue; that<note place="margin">Chap. 11. <hi>Of Faith.</hi>
                  </note> which the Scripture layeth much ſtreſs upon, and that without which there is no Salvation: He that Believeth not ſhall be Damned. I ſhall therefore ſpeak ſomething diſtinctly concerning this Great and Divine Virtue of Faith: It's ſatisfying and ſaving Faith only, that I ſhall endeavour to be ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>1. I ſhall diſcover what Faith is; Faith in<note place="margin">1. What Faith is.</note> it ſelf (take it on all Accounts) is a giving Credence to the Truth of God, it is to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God: Faith is a giving Credit to, or Believing a Report, be it in Humane or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things: To give Credit to Humane Relations on Humane Teſtimony, is a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith; to give Credit to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Report of God in the Goſpel, is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith.</p>
               <p>So that the Divine Faith of the Goſpel to which Life is promiſed, is a Hearty giving Credit to, and Believing of the Truth or God, and Chriſt in the Goſpel, with a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40486:79"/> hearty conſenting to be Saved, and Ruled by the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Divine Faith, is a giving Credence to, and believing of the Truth of God in the Goſpel; this (according to the Miniſtration) hath been accounted the True Faith in all Generations, to Believe, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God. This was the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, <hi>Gen. 15. 6. Rom.</hi> 4. 3. Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſs;</hi> and it was accompanied with Obedience: Faith and Obedience always goes together, elſe it's none of the Faith of <hi>God's Elect,</hi> Heb. 11 8. <hi>By Faith,</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was called to go out into a Place, which he ſhould after Receive for an Inheritance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whither he went,</hi> Jam. 2. 22. <hi>See you how Faith wrought with his Works, and by VVorks was his Faith made perfect:</hi> And this was the Faith required, and accepted throughout that Miniſtration, 2 <hi>Chron. 20. 20. Believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed; Believe his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye proſper.</hi> And their Failing herein, was their great Sin and Reproof, and the Cauſe of their other Sins and Judgments, <hi>Deut. 1 32.

How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not Believed, and how ſhall they Believe on him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> Where the Apoſtle, even from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon, concludes, that as Faith is abſolutely neceſſary to calling on the Lord, ſo is Hearing the Doctrine of the Goſpel abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Neceſſary to Believing; that is, to inſtruct in the Matter what to Believe, which without the Doctrine of the Goſpel cannot
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40486:80"/> be without a Miracle, which hath not been, nor is it God's way of Working; and by the Goſpel, do the Lord Efficatiouſly work the Saving Faith of the Goſpel, <hi>Col. 2. 12. Heb. 12. 2. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 5. It's by the Word that Faith comes, <hi>John</hi> 17. 20. The Word being the Divine Revelation of the Will of God, accompanied with the Divine Power of God, accompliſheth the Work, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3 What are the Grounds and Objects of<note place="margin">3. The Grounds and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith.</note> Faith? The Ground of Faith, is the Truth and faithfulneſs of God in his Word, and his All-ſufficiency to perform it.</p>
               <p>1. His Truth and Faithfulneſs; the Ground or Reaſon, why you believe a Man is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you judge him to be Honeſt and True, that he will not (knowingly) tell you a Lye; it's true, in matter of Law, for Ending of Controverſies among Men, both by the Law of God and Men; the Oath of Two (in Common) determineth the Caſe, from Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that they will not Swear falſe. Though (according to the Proverb) the Word of one honeſt Man is a Surer ground of Credence, than the Oath of Two Lyers; but the Truth of God in Divine Credence, is the ſure Ground of Faith: And when a Soul comes to this pitch of Faith, to Believe, that he that hath ſpoken is God that cannot Lye; that <hi>Faithful is he that hath promiſed, who will do it.</hi> Then he is quiet, it puts the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of doubt; and for this, he hath <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us Two Immutable things, in which it is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40486:80"/> impoſſible for God to Lye,</hi> Heb. 6. 18. In which is included the Mercy of God; for it is his Mercy to promiſe, and his Truth and Faithfulneſs to perform: Hence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>Mercy and Truth are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Pſal.</hi> 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 10. And the coming of our Lord into the World, was to <hi>perform the Mercy promiſed to our Fathers, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Holy Covenant,</hi> Luke 1. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So that there is a Concurrency of Mercy and Truth in God as the Ground of our Faith. 2. The All-ſufficiency of God to perform his Word, his Mercy, and his Truth, is the ground of Faith. If an honeſt Man promiſe you that which he is able to perform, you give great Credency thereunto; though there can be no Infallible Credence in this Matter: For Men (be they never ſo Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet) have not the power of Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance in themſelves, therefore may fail; but God hath all power of Perforance in himſelf; and this was the ground of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi> Faith, <hi>Rom. 4. 21. Being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able to perform:</hi> And when God commanded him to offer his Son, (for which he had ſo ſtrong Faith) he fixes both on the Truth and Power of God; and on that account yields ready Obedience, <hi>Accounting that God was able to raiſe him up, even from the Dead,</hi> Heb. 11. 19. There is likewiſe an All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the Lord Jeſus, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, and Work of Salvation for<note place="margin">The Obiect of Faith.</note> all true Believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:40486:81"/>
               <p>And the ſame, that is the Ground, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Object of Faith; that is, to what, and to whom we are to look in Believing, that is to God and Chriſt, <hi>Who performeth all things for us:</hi> We are to look to him, and Believe in him; to have God and Chriſt in their Mercy, Truth, Faithfulneſs and Power always in our Eye, <hi>Iſa. 45. 22. Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the ends of the Earth;</hi> that is, <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> Mich. 7. 7. <hi>Therefore will I look to the Lord, and wait for the God of my Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa. 17. 7. John</hi> 3. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>4. What is the Excellency of Faith? Faith<note place="margin">4.

In a Word, true Repentance is the turning of the whole Man from Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God; to Believe and Obey the Goſpel, for where the Mind is eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So the laſt Eſtate may be worſe than the firſt; but it's the turning from the Power of Sin and Satan to God, <hi>Acts 26. 18. Iſa. 55 7.

               <p>The Life of Saints is a Life of Watching, Warring, Repenting, Mourning, Praying, Believing, and Obeying, till they come to Glory; every New ſin muſt be repented of, and the Body of Death muſt be Mourned under; and the Pardon of Purging of not only known, but unknown ſins muſt be prayed for, <hi>Pſal. 19. 12.

Hence it is that Juſtification and Salvation is ſo frequently in Scripture propounded on theſe Terms, and indeed it's never propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but on theſe Terms, either Expreſt or Implied; this was the Doctrine which was <hi>firſt begun to be preached by</hi> the Lord, <hi>Mark 1. 14, 15. and confirmed by them that heard him,</hi> and were Commiſſioned by him, <hi>Mar. 16. 15, 16 Luke</hi> 24. 47. according to that Commiſſion ſo they taught in this matter, <hi>Act. 2. 38.

Relating to God. 2. Our ſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> on the Terms of Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience. I ſhall in this ſpeak more diſtinctly unto the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, and endeavour to anſwer ſuch Queſtions and Objections, as ordinarily are, or may be made about it.</p>
               <p>What the Faith is to which Juſtification is promiſed, I have already ſtated in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. that it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God in his Word, to believe the Truth of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, of God's Grace to Sinners in Jeſus Chriſt, which if True and Right, is accompanied with true Repentance, Truth of Love to God, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40486:97"/> ſincere Obedience; or a Hearty and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Conſenting to the Truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, and in all things to be Ruled by him as Lord and King.</p>
               <p>They are vain Imaginations that People create to themſelves, of a Faith without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or a Faith with Works, or a Faith without Works after their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and not after the Will of Chriſt, or to expect to be ſaved by him, when they have no mind to be ruled by him, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23. But as to the particular diſtinct Act of Faith, it is to believe God in his Word; and that not only in this, but in all Caſes, Faith is to believe God: It's a Fancy and not Faith, that hath not the Word of God for it's Foundation. I intend in Divine and New Covenant Concerns; Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was accounted unto him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> This was the Faith of the Father, and may, or muſt we ſuppoſe the Faith of the Children to be another Faith; ſee <hi>Verſ. 23. 24.

Yet ſtill in Purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. will clear us in this matter, and many other things of like concern, that God <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth things that are not, as though they were.</hi> They are not in Actual being, yet are in his Purpoſe to be in time; we may as well ſay God made the World before he did it, and that the World was Drowned before it was, and that Chriſt was come in the Fleſh, and had Suffered, and was Raiſed, and Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and come again to Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, or is, becauſe it was God's Purpoſe, that all theſe, and Multitudes more of things ſhould be done, which is indeed contrary to all Reaſon, and would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all Truth to ſay it is done: and as for Actual Juſtification, when Chriſt Dyed, and Roſe again; it's true, there was Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Satisfaction to Divine Juſtice, both gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and taken, in order to Juſtification; but Satisfaction is one thing, and Juſtification is another.</p>
               <p>It's true, if Chriſt had done for us, what he did, as our Surety, being bound with us to pay our Debt, if we could not; and in ſo doing, had fully anſwered the Law to which we were liable; then Actual Juſtification muſt have followed Actual Satisfaction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all terms of Believing and Obeying; for if the Surety pay the Debt, and Cancel the Bond, in ſtricteſt Law, the Principle is quit without any terms, and likewiſe no need of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40486:104"/> pardoning Grace, if the Satisfaction was ſuch, that Chriſt as our Surety, paid our Debt in ſtricteſt Law-ſence; but it's evident, that what Chriſt did for, and in behalf of Sinners, was by voluntary Contracts between the Father and the Son, <hi>John 6. 38, 39. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 9. and voluntarily undertaken by the Lord; and the Satisfaction that Chriſt gave, and Juſtice took, was not the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Debt in kind, as our Surety ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to it, if we could not do it; neither was he the Perſon that the Law might expect Satisfaction from; for the Law ſaith, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, that ſhall Die,</hi> and <hi>We all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi> So that the Satisfaction that Chriſt gave, was voluntarily given, and graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Received and Accepted, as Acts of Grace to us, both in the Son in Suffering, and the Father in Accepting; and therefore it muſt come to us, as it is indeed, Acts of Grace; and on the terms agreed on between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, which are publiſhed in the Goſpel; and it was no ways intended to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Sinners preſently without any more adoe; no, it holds true, <hi>That he that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is Baptized, ſhall be Saved; but he that Believeth not, ſhall be Damned.</hi> Therefore it concerns you to take heed how you underſtand Actual Juſtification, to be, when there was Actual Satisfaction, leſt you put an end to the Terms and Conditions of Juſtification by the Law-Covenant of Grace, and to the Pardoning Grace of

               <p>I Shall now come to ſpeak ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<note place="margin">Of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith.</note> Goſpel-aſſurance, or the aſſurance of Faith, whether the aſſurance of intereſt in Juſtification and Salvation may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this life, on this ſide the poſſeſſion of the purchaſed inheritance: and as for the aſſurance of Faith, we muſt conſider it in two particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Aſſurance of Faith in the truth of the<note place="margin">Aſſurance of Faith in the Doctrin.</note> Doctrine to be believed, and the truth and faithfulneſs of God therein, this being the Faith to which Juſtification is promiſed, (as hath been before proved) and in this, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith is requiſite unto Juſtification and life; for if we falter in the truth of the Doctrine, we muſt needs fail in the whole; by believing the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God, we juſtifie him, <hi>and ſet to our ſeal that God is true;</hi> and he will juſtifie thoſe who juſtifie him: <hi>if we believe not, yet be abideth faithful,</hi> (to thoſe who believe,) <hi>he will not, he cannot deny himſelf, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 13. this being the Faith of Juſtification and life, of this we ought to be fully aſſured,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40486:115"/> and infallibly, and undoubtedly ſatisfied of the truth of God in his Word, and of all things related therein, relating to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, raiſed and aſcended: <hi>Joh. 6. 69. We believe, and are ſure, that thou art the Chriſt the Son of the Living God,</hi> Chap. 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins;</hi> ſo that Aſſurance in this is poſitively neceſſary, <hi>i. e.</hi> the full aſſurance of Faith; this <hi>Peter</hi> Preached as neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>Act. 2. 36 therefore let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus, whom ye have crucified, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th Lord and Chriſt; 1 Theſ. 1. 5. Our Goſpel came not to you in word only, but alſo in Power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much aſſurance, &amp;c.</hi> to that end was thoſe mighty gifts given to, and by the Apoſtles in the Primitive time, for confirmation of the truth of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>Act. 5. 3. 1 Pet.</hi> 12. which confirmation ſtands firm to us, and to all believers to the Worlds end; though, it's true, it is by the work of the ſame ſpirit, in the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that doth eſtabliſh our hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>Yet in this it's poſſible for gracious ſouls ſometimes to be under temptation, and to want that aſſurance of Faith as is requiſite in ſo weighty a matter as this is; there is no temptation but a Chriſtian may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with; conſent is the dangerous ſin, and in this matter, to depart from the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40486:115"/> Faith, and to reject Chriſt crucified, and Salvation by him, is the unpardonable ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. 29. and 6. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Many gracious ſouls trouble themſelves<note place="margin">The unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin in two things.</note> about this ſin, fearing themſelves to be guilty thereof, through their ignorance of the ſin what it is: all ſin (it's true) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Spirit, but the unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſin, or ſin unto death, conſiſts eſpecially in two things;</p>
               <p n="1">1. A wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul departing from the Faith, and refuſing and rejecting Salvation by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt crucified, by perſons after they have profeſſed Faith in him, and obedience to him, according to thoſe Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A wilful and malicious oppoſing of the Spirits workings, or any known truth of the Lord Jeſus, after conviction, that it is the Holy Spirit, and the truth of the Lord Jeſus; yet contrary to light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of conſcience, for baſe, by, and fleſhly ends to oppoſe, contradict, and blaſpheme, is the ſin againſt the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and this is it mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31, 32. with <hi>v.</hi> 24. but for Chriſtians to meet with doubtings about the matters of Faith, (though they ought to watch and war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it) they have no ground to draw ſad concluſions againſt themſelves, though it's cauſe of humiliation. For ſupport in ſuch caſes, conſider, 1. The Prophet, <hi>Pſal</hi> 89. 34. 19, to 37. the Lord having made great
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40486:116"/> and precious promiſes to <hi>David,</hi> and in him to Chriſt, on the new covenant account, in which was much of the Goſpel Grace; yet immediately his Faith fails in the whole, as if God had made void his covenant, and broken all his promiſes in that matter, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. 45. which hath been fulfilled on the natural ſeed, and worldly Kingdom, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearance: but as it related to Jeſus Chriſt, it ſtands firm, and he is exalted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, and the Promiſe is ſure to all thee ſeed. 2. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who had many high confirmations from Heaven concerning the Lord Jeſus, that he was the Chriſt; he ſaw the ſign upon him, which God gave him, by which he ſhould know him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 33. inſomuch that he could ſay, <hi>ver. 34. 56. I ſaw, and bear record, that this is the Son of God; and behold the Lamb of God, &amp;c.</hi> and heard the voice from Heaven ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, &amp;c.</hi> yet after all theſe teſtimonies and aſſurances of his Faith in this matter, he being in Priſon, comes to doubt whether he was the Chriſt or not, <hi>Matt. 11. 3. Art thou him that ſhould come, or do we lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k for another?</hi> which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that there was in <hi>John</hi> a doubt whether he was the Chriſt or no: and this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only by the meſſage or queſtion, but if we conſider, 2. the time when he ſent, when he was in Priſon; it was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon temptation: 2. By the anſwer of Chriſt to <hi>John</hi> to ſtrengthen him under this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

                  <hi>Go and ſhew</hi> John <hi>thoſe things that you do hear and ſee, &amp;c.</hi> 2. By his anſwer to the multitude, <hi>What went ye out to ſee, a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed ſhaken with the wind? &amp;c.</hi> which clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that <hi>John</hi> was ſhaken in his Faith; and yet for all that, he was <hi>a Prophet, and more than a Prophet, v.</hi> 9. Which clearly imports, that gracious ſouls may come under temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and doubts in matters of Faith of higheſt concernment, and yet be gracious ſtill: yea further, gracious perſons may, through a ſudden fit of fear, and ſurpriſal by temptation, not only doubt in the main matters of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but even deny the Faith they have been eſtabliſhed in. The caſe of <hi>Peter</hi> is full in this matter, who denied and forſwore his Lord: but the difference lieth here, the gracious perſon may fall by a ſudden ſurpriſal of ſinful fear, and weep bitterly for it when it is done, and loves the Lord the more; but the other deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately reſolved, and wilfully departs from the Lord, and will no more of him, but with <hi>the dog returns to his vomit, and with the ſow that was waſhed, to her wallowing again in the mire:</hi> yet it deeply concerns ſouls to be heedful of ſuch temptations.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond ſort of Aſſurance, is the<note place="margin">2. Of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Intereſt.</note> aſſurance of intereſt in the Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and in ſpeaking to this, I ſhall ſhew, 1. That there is a Goſpel Aſſurance of intereſt in Grace and Glory to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this World. 2. What this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40486:117"/> is, and how, and how far it may be attained. 3. What it is that ordinarily hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders perſons from obtaining thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a well grounded Goſpel Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance<note place="margin">1. That it may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> of Faith may be attained here in this life; it is that which many Saints have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and a poſſibility is ſtated for all to attain it. 1. That many have attained it, <hi>Job,</hi> though under afflictions, yet could ſay, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job.</hi> 19. 25. 27. and the Prophet could ſay, after a cloud of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and temptation, <hi>Pſal. 73. 24. 26. Thou ſhalt guide me by thy counſel, and afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me to Glory;</hi> and <hi>Paul, Gal. 2. 20. I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me:</hi> and 2 <hi>Tit. 4. 7, 8. I have fought a good Fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith, from henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge will give me at that day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But, 2. Leſt it be objected by any, that theſe were extraordinary perſons, and therefore may doubt whether it be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by believers as ſuch; a poſſibility is ſtated for all to attain it: and this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the promiſe; it's promiſed (not Prophets, or Apoſtles, or Miniſters as ſuch) to all Believers; <hi>he that believeth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and <hi>John 6. 40. and this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40486:117"/> have everlaſting life,</hi> ſee <hi>Act. 16. 31. Rom.</hi> 10. 9. If God hath made the promiſe of life to believers as ſuch, without diſtinction, he hath ſtated a poſſibility to believers to obtain a Goſpel aſſurance of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears in that it was the Apoſtles work, (and ſhould be the work and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of every faithful Miniſter) to help Believers in this matter, that ſo they might attain a well groun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe things have I written to them that believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that ye may know that ye have eternal life,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord's deſign is not only to give his people eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, but he would have them to know it for their comfort; and for that end he hath ſtated clear grounds in his Word, by which they may come to know it, as I ſhall endeavour in the ſecond place to ſhew what it is, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ow it may be attained.</p>
               <p>2. What this Aſſurance is, and how far it may be attained 1. What it is, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture ſometimes, the aſſurance of Faith, <hi>Heb. 10. 22. Let us draw near in full aſſurance of Faith,</hi> Heb. 6. 11. <hi>The full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of hope, the full aſſurance of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>

Heb. 10. 35. <hi>The confidence of hope;</hi> Heb. 3. 6. <hi>Whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confidence, and the rejoycing of the hope firm to the end.</hi> The aſſurance of Faith, Hope, Confidence, is ſometimes higher, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lower; ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, according to the ſouls exerciſe in the word of Life, and work of Faith, and the working of the Spirit in the word of Faith; for there is no ſuch aſſurance to be attained here, as when we come to the poſſeſſion of the Kingdom and Glory promiſed, when all occaſion of doubting ſhall be done away: for the aſſurance here, is but the aſſurance of Faith, Hope, and Confidence, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords Peace, Joy, and Conſolation: the Scripture (and ſo muſt reaſon too) make a vaſt diſproportion between the life of Faith, and the life of preſent and full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. We live by Faith, and not by ſight,</hi> that is, not by preſent injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Heb. 10. 38. Now the juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> that is, now in this ſide the Glory promiſed, in which it may be ſuppoſed, is danger of drawing back: <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. How it muſt be obtained; the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance<note place="margin">2. How it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> of Faith and hope muſt be attained by a reflect act of the ſoul, or a reſultancy, or concluſion from the condition, on which life is promiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to inſtance, <hi>Mat. 5. 3. &amp;c.</hi> are many precious promiſes made to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40486:118"/> that are indowed with thoſe Divine Virtues therein expreſt, as, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. Who ſo finds thoſe Virtues in him, may, and ought to claim his intereſt in the promiſes: ſo <hi>Mat. 16. 16. He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> that is, he that believeth, and obeyeth the Lord, (of which, Baptiſm is the firſt, and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the whole duty of the Goſpel) ſhall be ſaved; I do believe and obey the Goſpel, therefore I ſhall be ſaved: ſo 1 <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whoſoever doth believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God;</hi> this Faith, if right, is accompanied with thoſe other Virtues mentioned, as love to God, love to his people, obedience to his will, and <hi>his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous, it getteth victory over the World,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>ver. 2. By this we know we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his Commandments;</hi> ver. 3. <hi>For this is the love of God, that we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Commandments are not grievous:</hi> that is, they are not grievous to Believers; <hi>ver. 4. Whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the World; and this is the victory that overcometh the World, even your Faith.</hi> What the World is that Faith overcometh, the Apoſtle had before explained, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 15, 16, 17. Faith getteth the victory, by fixing the ſoul on better objects than the World is: <hi>Heb. 5. 9. He is become the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> Now the reſultancy from the whole is, I do believe that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:40486:119"/> is the Chriſt, and my Faith is accompanied with love to God above all, and do love his people for his ſake; and do ſincerely deſire to know and do his will, and keep his Commandments; they are not grievous to me, but my failing therein, is my grief; and by this Faith I have overcome the World, and am dead to it; and it is my real deſire and endeavour to abandon all things that are contrary to the will of the Lord, <hi>to abhor that which is evil, and to cleave to that which is good;</hi> therefore I am born of God, therefore I have an intereſt in the new covenant, this is the way appointed of God, in which they may make <hi>their Calling</hi> and <hi>Election ſure,</hi> if they give diligence to it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. and theſe are the things that <hi>John</hi> write in his Epiſtle to them that <hi>did believe, that they might know that they had eternal life, 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 13. and according to our abounding in thoſe Divine Virtues, or not abounding, ſo will our aſſurance be, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11.</p>

               <p>But the Goſpel miniſtration is a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Liberty, Life, and Peace, by that one Sacrifice once offered for all, that there is no cauſe of fear for need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrifice; ſo that the ſpirit of the Goſpel in the miniſtration thereof, hath its natural tendency to take away legal fear out of the hearts of Believers, <hi>where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> that is, from the ſpirit of bondage: it doth not import that the Saints are freed from the filial fear of God, nor from fear of ſinning againſt him, nor from having an holy fear of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, leſt they come ſhort, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1.</p>

That it is mercy when the Lord does bring Scripture to remembrance, to his people, ſuitable to their conditions, for their comfort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; I doubt not but that God doth inſtruct, ſupport and comfort his people in this way: yet, 2. This is not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture way in which ſouls may undoubtedly read their intereſt: it's true, it's matter of meditation and conſolation to gracious ſouls, to have the Word brought into their remembrance, but not the way preſcribed by which they may undoubtedly conclude their intereſt.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:40486:125"/>
               <p>2. The Scripture ſaith, that we ſhould be able and <hi>ready to give a reaſon of our hope;</hi> now this is no ſufficient reaſon, according to the Scripture, either to ſatisfie our ſelves or others, that I had ſuch a Scripture brought home to me at ſuch a time, in which the aſſurance of my intereſt in Grace and Life was ſealed: this ſingly of it ſelf may be true or falſe, if there be not the rational Scripture ground, that is, the true work of Grace; it's a hundred to one but it's falſe and deluſive, therefore, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the work of the Spirit, it's no ſure ground; for Satan can make uſe of Scripture to deceive ſouls. So that I ſay, that evidence that may admit of doubt, and if the party receiving it, be void of thoſe evidences I have minded, then it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly falſe, and therefore not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidently to be built upon.</p>
               <p>But in the other way, of concluding our intereſt from the work of the Spirit in us, ſuitable to the Word without us, when there is an anſwerableneſs in this matter, it's ſurely of God, and in this the Devil will not, cannot deceive you; it works you more to love, and be like the Lord: but the other, if not right, it ſerves rather to harden, and to cure miſcarriages ever after. Well, ſaith ſuch a ſoul, I had ſuch a word brought in at ſuch a time, in ſuch a manner, in which I was ſealed: I will never let go that, it was of God, I fear neither
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40486:126"/> Devil nor men, &amp;c. Though the right uſe of former experiences is precious, yet I fear this hath proved to the damage of many ſouls.</p>
               <p>And on the other hand, gracious and tender ſouls that hath the root of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them, underſtanding that this is the ſuppoſed way to get aſſurance; and having no experience thereof in themſelves, put their ſouls upon the rack of doubts and fears without cauſe, fearing they have no Faith, being afraid to draw concluſions from right Goſpel grounds: O, ſaith the ſoul, I never had experience of ſuch a ſealing evidence, therefore I fear all is naught.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some talk of aſſurance at ſuch a rate, not only as if it muſt come in ſome ſtrange immediate way from the Spirit, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it muſt come to whom, and when he pleaſeth, and that it's retained from ſome for ever; that is, in this World, and as if it were reſerved to ſometimes, and for ſome perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this puts tender and ſerious ſouls to a doubt in the matter, where ever they may meet with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aſſurance of the love of God to their ſouls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I ſay, it's true it is the gift of God, but no other than the Spirit and Faith is, and if <hi>any one hath not the Spirit of God, and Faith, he is none of his;</hi> and whoever can aſſure himſelf that he hath the Spirit
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40486:126"/> of Chriſt, is ſure of all; for God no more with-holds aſſurance from any of his, than he does his Spirit, and the virtues thereof; but it is as common for all Saints as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, though all Saints are not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly inſtructed herein: God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons, he would have all his little ones to have the conſolations of the Goſpel: it is true, there are cauſes why God may hide his face from his people in this matter, but that relates to themſelves as the cauſe, which is the ſecond hindrance of aſſurance.</p>

Sin ſometimes juſtly hinders aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when it is regarded in the heart, and unrepented of; it ſtares in the conſcience, and fills the ſoul with fear; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if ſin be harboured ſecretly in the ſoul, whether it be pride, covetouſneſs, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, diſobedience, neglect of duty, loſs of firſt love, &amp;c. one of theſe two things
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40486:127"/> muſt neceſſarily follow; either, 1. a dull inſenſible, hardened frame, without all fear or doubts: or, 2. Clowds and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, doubts and fears do ariſe about inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and that juſtly too, till the ſoul do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, forſake, and turn to the Lord; <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my Prayer;</hi> there is the ſame reaſon as well as rule, for a Believer to repent of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can have true Peace, as for a ſinner in the firſt work of Converſion; for ſin is the ſame ſtill where-ever it is; and on this account it is, that God doth hide himſelf from his people, and leave them under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and ſorrow, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 20. And on this account it is, that perſons may have a comfortable aſſurance, and loſe the ſenſe thereof again, by renewed acts of ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance.</p>
               <p>3. Hindrance is, miſtakes in the manner<note place="margin">3. Is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and method of the Spirits working, and ſo of witneſſing in ſome caſes, proves a great hindrance to Chriſtians in their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; by reaſon of which, gracious ſouls take up that againſt themſelves, as an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, which is one of the moſt aſſured grounds of the truth of Grace, and of the Spirits working; to inſtance, <hi>Joh</hi> 16. 8, 9, 11. The Spirits work is <hi>to convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment;</hi> now when the Spirit in the Word effects this work in the hearts of ſinners, when they ſee themſelves to be ſinners, and miſerable
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40486:127"/> in themſelves, and that they are unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that their own righteouſneſs is nothing worth, and that there is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in Chriſt for ſinners, <hi>becauſe he is gone to the Father</hi> to make good his ſuffering on that account, and of the certainty of Judgment, <hi>becauſe the Prince of this World is judged;</hi> this work being effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in them, they ſink in their ſpirits, and think they are undone, that there is no hope of mercy, when they are in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of mercy and the Spirits working in order to their eternal ſafety. Hard it is to ſuffer the loſs of all things, not only their ſins, but their own righteouſneſs, and to ſubmit themſelves to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. and this not only in the firſt work of Converſion, but after ſome progreſs in Chriſtianity; many gracious perſons are exceeding liable to this miſtake: O, ſaith the gracious ſoul, (that lives moſt in ſelf-examination, and ſo in the knowledg of himſelf, and the badneſs of his own nature) I find ſuch a deadneſs in my nature, ſuch an indiſpoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to that which is good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I fear all is naught, and that it is not for ſuch a one as I to think that I have any thing of good in me. This, I know, is the caſe and complaint of many gracious ſouls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this is one of the moſt undoubted evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of being poſſeſt with the Spirit of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40486:128"/> Chriſt, and ſo in a ſtate of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 10. The Apoſtle having aſſerted this truth, <hi>That if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> but how ſhall I know that I have the Spirit of Chriſt? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle anſwers this queſtion; <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin, but the Spirit is life becauſe of righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, if the Spirit of Chriſt be in you, it hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered your own death to you; you ſee that there is nothing but death in your own nature, becauſe of ſin, <hi>but the Spirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, if the Spirit of Chriſt be in you, it hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered your own death to you; you ſee there is nothing but death in your bodies by reaſon of ſin, but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the Grace, the Mercy, the pardon of ſin for the ſake of Chriſt, is the life of your Spirits; this is a certain evidence of the Spirits work, when it cauſeth ſouls to be ſenſible of their own death, and the life that is in Chriſt Jeſus, and that not only in their firſt converſion and turning to the Lord; but it keeps up, and carrieth on that work in the hearts of Believers all the daies they live in this world, <hi>Col. 3. 3. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God:</hi> not only dead to ſin, but you do, or ſhould know, that there is nothing but death in your nature, as of your ſelves, and your life is in Chriſt hid there; ſo that ſometimes Chriſtians themſelves that are
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40486:128"/> intereſſed in it can ſcarce ſee it, or believe it, altogether hid from wicked men; they are ſtrangers to it, and as for the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hid from all Saints, <hi>till Chriſt who is our life do appear, then ſhall they appear with him in Glory,</hi> v. 4. that this is ſo ſure a character of the Spirits working, doth further appear, <hi>Rom. 7. 18. I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing.</hi> O, but when Chriſtians are taught this leſſon, they think they are undone, and ſo indeed they are in themſelves, but it's an high diſcovery of the Spirits working; the fleſh never did, never will diſcover its own badneſs; but the fleſh will be alwaies priding it ſelf, and puffing it ſelf up, though altogether without cauſe; but, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matt. 5. 3. That is, thoſe who are ſenſible of their own poverty, and want of all good in themſelves, that what of virtue is in them, is of the Lord, and from him, and that their righteouſneſs and life is of free Grace in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that this (it's evident) hath been a needleſs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance in the way of the Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and is rather a ſtrong ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in the truth of their partaking of Goſpel Grace.<note place="margin">4. Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance is, miſtake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
               </p>
               <p>4. Hindrance is, that miſtaken notion amongſt many Chriſtians, that is, that we muſt ſeek God and his Glory only in all our ſeekings, ſervices and ſufferings, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40486:129"/> not any thing for our ſelves; O, ſaith the gracious ſoul, I cannot, I dare not lie, I find that I cannot but have reſpect to my ſelf, and mine own ſalvation; if that were left out, I ſhould ſink and fail in the work, and that makes me fear that it is not right, what-ever I do.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs this is a miſtaken notion, and contrary to the very drift and ſcope of the Goſpel; for the great deſign of God in the work of Redemption, next his own Glory, was the ſalvation of poor ſinners; and to ſuppoſe that God would have his people to leave out their own good and ſalvation in the Goſpel work, which he himſelf hath ſo much deſigned in the whole work of Goſpel Redemption, is contrary to all (both divine and humane) reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The incouragement to believing, obeying, and ſuffering is this, Juſtification, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39. Salvation, <hi>Mar. 16. 16. Act 16. 31. Rom.</hi> 2. 10. Augmentation of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. And certainly God would never have ſtated theſe as incouragements, if he would not have his people to have reſpect thereto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is that which hath been the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Saints throughout all generations, and that which they had in their eyes, to which they had reſpect, and which they ſought after, <hi>Matt. 19. 27. Peter</hi>'s queſtion, with Chriſt's gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>We have left all, and followed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e; and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40486:129"/> what ſhall we have? Heb.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15, 16. deſcribes the Patriarks to be ſeeking a Countrey, and ſo to have reſpect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, and God's owning them therein; <hi>wherefore</hi> (even for ſeeking an heavenly Country according to the will of God) <hi>he was not aſhamed to be called their God;</hi> for he hath prepared for them a City, <hi>ver. 24, 25, 26. Moſes</hi> left <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi> houſe, and <hi>refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh'<hi>s Daughter, and choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; esteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of</hi> Egypt; <hi>for he had reſpect unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 24. to 27. <hi>Rom. 2. 7. Heb. 10. 34. 36. Rev.</hi> 22. 14. with multitudes of like Scriptures that might be mentioned in this matter. In all which it appears, that it is the will of God, and hath been the deſign of the Saints in all ages, to be ſeeking after their own ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal welfare: and indeed it's one of the firſt exhortations of Chriſt to his, <hi>First ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, &amp;c.</hi> and the reward is that which all true Believers muſt and do believe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
               <p>To clear this matter further, I ſhall mind<note place="margin">4 Things to clear this matter.</note> four things, 1. That we are to ſeek God and his Glory firſt and chiefly, becauſe he is the chiefeſt good; and in ſeeking him, and finding him, we find all; yet not to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40486:130"/> leave out our ſelves, and our own good in ſeeking him, it is for his worth that we ſeek him, that we may be able in truth to ſay as the Prophet, <hi>Lam. 3. 24. The Lord is my Portion, ſaith my ſoul, therefore will I hope in him;</hi> for when once the ſoul hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and in God, he hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in all, 1 <hi>Joh 5. 12. He that hath the Son, hath life,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>2. He that truly ſeeketh the honour of God and Chriſt, ſeeketh his own honour in the right way; he that taketh care of the honour of God and Chriſt in the right way, (that is, in believing, loving, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the truth,) God will take care for his honour, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. the Lord ſaith, <hi>He that honoureth me, I will honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If we ſeek our ſelves in the way that God hath appointed, we cannot miſcarry, that is, in the loſe of our ſelves, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Lord alone, expecting all from Grace, in the way of Faith and Obedience, not for any meritorious good that is in us; that when we have done all we can, ſee and ſay, that we are unprofitable Servants, and cry Grace, Grace, to the whole work, both for us, and in us, then we rightly ſeek God and Glory.</p>
               <p>4. It's true in one ſenſe, that we may not ſeek our ſelves by any means, that is, our own eſteem and glory here among men, or to be lifted up in our own minds, that is, fleſhly, and of the firſt man, that muſt be
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40486:130"/> mortified, as a dangerous and ſoul-ruining, and God-diſhonouring evil, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are too much by nature inclined to, through the remainders of the old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature; and muſt be watched and warded againſt; ſelf-wiſdom, ſelf-will, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem, ſelf-boaſting, and ſelf-glorying, is to be abandoned; but in ſeeking after and obeying of God and Chriſt, <hi>To ſeek glory, honour, and eternal life,</hi> is ſo conſiſtent with the truth of the Goſpel, that it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſever them, whatever ſouls fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vainly imagine to the contrary; <hi>What God hath joyned together, let no man put aſunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Hindrance of ſouls aſſurance is, when<note place="margin">5. Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, when ſouls trouble themſelves about Gods Decrees.</note> they trouble themſelves about the Decrees and Counſel of God, whether Elected, or not Elected; if they are not Elected, then it's in vain for them to believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not a work for Chriſtians to trouble their minds about, neither are they like to have the aſſurance of Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, while they make this their firſt work: I ſhall for help in this matter, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe theſe ſeven things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt died for all, and that the<note place="margin">7 Things conſidered in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> love of God in the Goſpel is truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to all, and that all are brought under it, either in a way of life or death; life, if they repent, believe, and obey it; death, if they re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ect it, 1 <hi>Tit. 2. 6. Heb. 2 9. 1 Joh. 4. 14. Joh. 3. 16, 17. Mar.</hi> 16. 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:40486:131"/>2. That all are invited, and required to believe and obey the Goſpel, with gracious promiſes of acceptance, by him that is truth it ſelf, and <hi>cannot lie,</hi> nor will he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe that come to him, <hi>Iſa. 55. 7. Matt. 11. 28. Acts 17. 30. 1 Tit.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the ſame reaſon for all to halt, and doubt in this matter, as for any one; and yet we find not any one men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture, among the many thouſands of Believers. that made a doubt on this ground, no, not of the worſt of ſinners: thoſe that had a hand in the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. 36, 37, 41. They gladly received the word of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not queſtioning the matter of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but glad, with the good news of Salvation, on the tearms propounded; with many like inſtances of Gentiles as well as Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did not propound Election as any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the Faith of any, but aſſures them, (where-ever they came) that on the tearms of the Goſpel they ſhould be ſaved; <hi>Acts 16. 31. Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor did the Apoſtles mention Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Believers after converſion, with any deſign to ſtumble them in the matter of Faith relating to their own intereſt, but that they might the more admire Grace, and live to the God of Grace, that they might not ſacrifice to their own net, nor
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40486:131"/> take the Glory of the work of God wrought in them, and for them, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but that they might give the glory of all to him, and live to him in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, <hi>Rom. 11. 6, 33. Eph.</hi> 1. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor hath God done any act (contrary to the free tenders and invitations of the Goſpel) that may tend to diſcourage, or hinder any from believing and obeying the Goſpel, that they may be ſaved; God's Electing ſome, that he might not loſe his deſign wholly in the reſtauration work, is no bar to hinder any, becauſe he affords means and helps to all; ſo that men ſhall one day acknowledge, that God is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and their damnation is of themſelves, and of their own choice; <hi>I would, but ye would not;</hi> ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20. to the end.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take heed of entertaining ſuch thoughts about the Decrees of God, (which are ſecret and hidden) as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Doctrine of the Goſpel, his revealed will; for all notions about the Decrees, really inconſiſtent with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace, and promiſe of life on the tearms of the Goſpel, are diſhonourable to God, and dangerous to your ſouls; therefore look you to the revealed will, believe and obey that, and you are ſafe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You are to know, that the way by which you ſhall know your Election, is by believing and obeying the truth; and ſure enough it is, that if you continue in a ſtate

               </p>
               <p>O therefore be wiſe, and ſtumble not where God hath laid no ſtumbling ſtone, but fall in with the truth, believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Goſpel, and you ſhall be ſaved; you are under all the precious promiſes of life, <hi>which are all yea and amen</hi> (certain and ſure) <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus, who is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all thoſe that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 19.</p>
               <p>The ſixt and laſt hindrance I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">6.

               <p>This of Hope, is a ſtep for the ſoul to ſtand upon, till it attain aſſurance; but when this is taken away, and the ſoul ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth there is no degree ſhort of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and finding that ſomething difficult, eſpecially to ſtep into it at one ſtep, lieth groveling on the ground without hope;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40486:132"/> but this we are to know, that Hope is a bleſſed Goſpel virtue, when rightly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and that Chriſtians may, and ſhould exerciſe it in this very caſe; ſtep up into Hope firſt, and there ſtand and wait till aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance come, that will come in by degrees, in the ſouls conſtancy in the Faith and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere walk with God, improving Divine Grace received, and acquaintance with the right way of attaining of aſſurance: it's true, that Hope as well as Faith admits of degrees; ſometimes there is the <hi>full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Hope,</hi> which is the next ſtep to the full aſſurance of Faith; we are <hi>ſaved by Hope</hi> as well as by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 24.

               <p>Now the well grounded hope of the Goſpel, muſt be on the ſame that Faith of intereſt is, on the ſame grounds muſt ſouls get firſt into hope, that is, the word and promiſes of the New Covenant, and the work effected in the heart; where there is an harmony in word and work, there is a ſtable ground for hope; as there is no ſtable ground for hope from the Word without the work, ſo is there no ground for hope from the work without the Word; but when the ſoul can ſay, I have believed, repented, and obeyed the Goſpel, and it is its deſire and endeavour to perſevere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the end, there is a Goſpel ground for hope of an intereſt in the precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. A further Diſcovery of the New Covenant, and Life of Faith.</head>
               <p>OF this much hath been ſpoken in what hath been before minded; yet I ſhall ſpeak a little more diſtinctly to it in this place.</p>
               <p>1. The Goſpel, or New Covenant, are<note place="margin">1. Of the Goſpel, or New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> tearms equivalent, and intends one and the ſame thing in ſubſtance; the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ſo called, becauſe it is the Covenant of the renewed Eſtate, of the new Life, and deliverance out of that eſtate of ſin and death into which we fell by the firſt tranſgreſſion; this Covenant relating to new men and women in Chriſt Jeſus, and the new World, the whole new eſtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and promiſed therein, made, 1. In and with Chriſt Jeſus the head of this new and glorious deſign of God, in the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and reſtauration work: and, 2. In him, with all the members of his body, the Church, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 9. On whom this deſign of God ſhall undoubtedly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being the glorious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted end and iſſue of the great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Chriſt our Lord in his ſuffering
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40486:134"/> for ſinners, <hi>Joh. 6. 38, 39. Eph</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. Called a Covenant of Grace, becauſe the regeneration and reſtauration work in all the parts thereof, is the effect of the free Grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and a Covenant (or promiſe) of Life, becauſe it is a deliverance from death, into a ſtate of Life, never to die again: it's called the Goſpel, which ſignifieth glad, or good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, <hi>Luke 2. 10. Rom.</hi> 10. 15. It imports all the good promiſed in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, of Pardon, Peace, Life, of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sanctification and Glory, with the way by which it is effected, that is, by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt crucified, raiſed and aſcended in the performance of his Mediatory Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 1, 3, 4. It intends the glad tidings of remiſſion of ſins by Jeſus Chriſt, and of Salvation; <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. It being one and the ſame commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it promiſeth remiſſion of ſins, and Salvation, on its own tearms, <hi>i. e.</hi> on Faith, Repentance and new Obedience; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſeth acceptation in ſervice, and gives rules relating thereunto, unto which all New Covenant ſpirited people ought to take heed, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23. It promiſeth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in ſervice, <hi>Iſa. 26. 12. 2 Cor. 5. 5. Phil. 2. 13. Eph.</hi> 1. 6. With eternal Life and Glory in the World to come, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, in the way of Faith Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſincere Obedience unto the end, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. Heb.</hi> 5. 9. This is the New
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40486:135"/> Covenant, the Goſpel, the glad tidings of Gods free Grace and good will to men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the diſcovery of the dreadful ſtate of all that do not believe and obey this Goſpel.</p>
               <p>There is Pardon and Peace, Grace and Life, a Kingdom and Glory, and that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, given by covenant and promiſe to all that in truth believe and obey the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9, &amp; 9. 5. Contained in that, <hi>Gen. 12. 3. In thee ſhall all thee Families of the Earth be bleſſed;</hi> which includes all the bleſſings of the New Covenant, relating to Grace and Glory: but of this I have written di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and of the Mediatory Office of Chriſt, in this New Covenant, in a Book entituled, <hi>The Diſcourſe of true Goſpel Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, or, The diſtinction of the two Covenants, Old and New;</hi> to which I refer the Reader that deſireth to ſee further in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And, 2. As for the Life of Faith in this<note place="margin">2. Of the Life of Faith.</note> Goſpel, or New Covenant, and the truth of God therein; what the Faith of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is, to which the promiſe is made, hath been before ſhewed: but the Scripture ſpeaks of living by Faith, <hi>Heb. 10. 38. Now the juſt ſhall live by Faith;</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 7. <hi>We live by Faith, and not by ſight;</hi> that is in this ſide the glory promiſed, we live by Faith, and not by preſent poſſeſſion and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; only the Spirit and Faith we have, as <hi>the Earneſt and Evidence of the Inheritance,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40486:135"/> and purchaſed Poſſeſſion,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 22. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
               <p>Now this Life of Faith imports three<note place="margin">The life of Faith in three things</note> things; 1. A conſtant abiding in the Faith and profeſſion of the Goſpel unto the end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. &amp; 10. 23, 38, 39. 2. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant exerciſe of Faith in the truth and faithfulneſs of God in all the good diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and promiſes of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 24. Faithful is he that hath called you, who will do it.</hi> Heb. 10. 23. <hi>Let us hold fast the profeſſion of our Faith without wavering, for faithful is he that hath promiſed.</hi> Faith right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed on the faithfulneſs and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of God, will <hi>fill the ſoul with Joy and Peace,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. To believe not only the truth of the <hi>mercy promiſed,</hi> but the faithfulneſs of God therein, and his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency in the performance thereof: this was it ſupported <hi>Abraham</hi> in his life of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 31. He did not only believe the faithfulneſs of God, but <hi>being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. When the ſoul thus abides in the Faith, and thus exerciſeth Faith on the good promiſes of the Goſpel, as that it is ſtrengthened, comforted, nurſed up, and nouriſhed thereby unto life eternal: when the ſoul is kept alive to God thereby in the greateſt temptations and difficulties this World affords, this is to live by Faith, to live by believing the truth of the good
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40486:136"/> Word of God to live by believing the truth of his precepts in the Goſpel, ſo as to obey him therein, the truth of all his great and precious promiſes of life, ſo as to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted therein, <hi>Matt. 17. 5. Rom.</hi> 15. 13. O that Chriſtians would ſtudy more this life of Faith, the want of which, is the cauſe they go on ſo heavily in the waies of the Goſpel, and meet with ſo many obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and hindrances therein; whereas, if the life of Faith were kept up more in the true nature thereof, how might Chriſtians make Chriſt's commands <hi>their ſongs,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for him their <hi>joy, in the houſe of their pilgrimage:</hi> but for want of this it is, that his ſervice is too often a burden, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for his ſake too much feared; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord would have his people to ſerve him with delight, and to ſuffer for him with joy, <hi>Pſ. 100. Luke 6. 22, 23. Acts</hi> 5. 41. Which is poſſible to be performed in this life of Faith, and no otherwiſe, <hi>Mark 9. 23. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Of Sanctification and Good Works.</head>
               <p>THE next thing in order that I ſhall ſpeak of, is, Sanctification and good Works; <hi>for whom he justiefith, them he ſanctifieth,</hi> and maketh to be an holy people for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Sanctification in Scripture-ſenſe, is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly<note place="margin">It's vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</note> underſtood and applied. 1. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a ſeparation to an holy uſe for a time, as was frequently uſed under the Law, which was a legal or ceremonial Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or ſeparation to an holy uſe for ſome time, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, conſecrated and hallowed for the Prieſts Office, which was a typical ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or hallowing, during that miniſtration, with their holy garments, as appears, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 1. &amp; 29. 1. Holy garments, holy place, holy anointing oil, holy veſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were all typical, and but for a time. But this is not the Sanctification that I am to ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>It's true, that in the Goſpel there are ſome ſanctified and holy inſtituted ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ordained, and left by our Lord for ſanctified and holy ends, to promote and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40486:137"/> carry on the work of Sanctification in his people till they come to Glory: but the Sanctification that I ſhall ſpeak of, is, the ſanctification of juſtified perſons, in order to Glory; for <hi>Without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>Sanctification in general, ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the whole work of Grace, a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſin, and vivification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which the whole life of Grace is carried on, and effected, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 23. And the very God of Peace ſanctifie you throughout; and I pray God that your whole ſpirit, ſoul and body be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 2. And more particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two parts; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and Inherent, or Imparted.</note> Sanctification conſiſteth of two parts, 1. Imputed, 2. Imparted, or Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; 1. Imputed, there is an imputed San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, as there is an imputed Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: if any ſcruple the time of imputed Sanctification, it's no other in ſenſe and ſubſtance, than the accounting the holineſs of Chriſt our Head in his own perſon, to be the Believers: the Scripture ſpeaks of an imputed righteouſneſs to Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7. Which muſt be their Faith, as, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 22, 23, 24. Or the pardon of ſin on the ſatisfaction of Chriſt by his death, which moſt properly is the righteouſneſs
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40486:137"/> of Saints unto Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. And on this account there is as much ſaid in Scripture for this imputed Sanctification as of Juſtification, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Who of God is made unto us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption;</hi> He is made to be our Wiſdom, and Sanctification, as our Righteouſneſs, that is, the perfect pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſt the Son of God, with his perfect and compleat obedience to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law of God, is reckoned and accounted the Believers, as their Sanctification, as he is not only wiſe for them, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of his Wiſdom to them, but as their Head, his Wiſdom is accounted theirs, and he is made to be their Righteouſneſs, that is, his death and ſatisfaction was accepted for us; and on that account does God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and pardon the ſins of Believers; and he is made our Sanctification, that is, his Sanctification is accounted ours; and this is fully included in, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. Where Chriſt is ſaid to be to Believers, <hi>All, and in all:</hi> all, in matter of Juſtification, and all in matter of Sanctification, <hi>and in all:</hi> effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the work of Sanctification in his people, <hi>by his Spirit that dwelleth in them:</hi> and in this ſenſe (as he is made the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of or to Believers, their Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is perfect, as their Juſtification is perfect, as conſidered in the Sanctification, and perfect holineſs and obedience of Chriſt: and hence it is the Apoſtle ſaith,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40486:138"/> 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 17. That as he is, ſo are we in this World;</hi> that is, by his imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs, accounted ſo of God, and he would have his people to know it for their comfort.</p>
               <p>2. Of the Inherent or Imparted Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; by it I intend the Sanctification wrought in us by the Spirit of Chriſt in and by the Word of the Goſpel; for that is the way of the Spirits working, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and from hence it is that Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is ſometimes attributed to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 2. 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 3. and 17. 17. Thereby to let us to know, that the Word effects it not without the Spirit, nor the Spirit without the Word.</p>
               <p>And this Sanctification is likewiſe to be<note place="margin">Imparted Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of two parts.</note> conſidered and underſtood under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration; 1. As within us; 2. As wrought and brought forth, and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; and that is it I join Sanctification and Works together; for all the Works of the Goſpel are the external parts of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is, Holineſs of Mind<note place="margin">1. Holineſs of mind.</note> and Spirit: The ſecond is, Holineſs of Converſation, univerſal Obedience to the Law of Chriſt. See both theſe together, <hi>Pſ. 45. 13. The Kings daughter is all glorious within, her cloathing is of wrought Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 1. This Sanctification, as it is in the Saints, it is an holy diſpoſition wrought
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40486:138"/> in them by the Spirit, through the Word of the Goſpel, which is called in Scripture ſometimes, the law of God written in the heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. in which is both Faith, Love, and Holineſs. Sometimes its called the <hi>new man, which is created after God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4. 24. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in knowledg after the image of him that created him,</hi> Col. 3. 10. It is after God, <hi>i. e.</hi> after his image and likeneſs; after God, that is, an holy diſpoſition and deſire to be more like the Lord in holineſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. After a conformity to his will in every thing, both within and without; deſires and endeavours daily the mortification of ſin, and to increaſe in the newneſs of the ſpirit of holineſs, ſuch a ſoul <hi>is minding the things of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 5. <hi>And with the mind do ſerve the law of God,</hi> Rom. 7. 25. Would be more like Chriſt whiles here in this mortal ſtate, 1 <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h. 3. 3. The mind and affections are ſet on things that are above,</hi> Col. 3. 1. And grows in the ſenſe of the ſinful nature, and body of death, which ſo much hinders their perfection in holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. And is <hi>waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of the body,</hi> Rom. 8. 23.</p>
               <p>And where this inward holineſs, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſition of heart is, there is not only an holy deſire of conformity to the Lord, and of appearing more in the image of Chriſt, but ſuch ſouls do <hi>ſanctifie the Lord in their hearts, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 15. That is, have
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40486:139"/> holy and reverend thoughts of him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his name and nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 9. They ſanctifie him in all his Ordinances, for their ſpiritual building up in the Faith, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 18. 129. In all his waies, and in all his works, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145. 17. Yea, in his afflicting, correcting diſpenſations, that are croſs to the fleſh, and unpleaſing to nature, yet the ſanctified heart doth ſanctifie God therein, and give him the glory, and juſtifie him in what he doth in this matter, <hi>Joh 1. 21. Pſ.</hi> 119. 65, 75.</p>
               <p>2. This ſanctification is to be conſidered<note place="margin">2. Of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</note> as it is brought, or wrought forth and made manifeſt, ſo that although it's a truth, that all external holineſs in appearance, not flowing from this inward principle of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and life, will end in obſcurity: yet it is as certain, that where-ever this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and life of Grace is, it brings forth the fruit of holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. And this in Scripture is called holineſs of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16. And includes all the good duties and works of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>This holineſs in converſation, or good<note place="margin">This is of two parts. 1. Such as concern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> and holy works of Saints conſiſteth of two parts; 1. Such as relates to our walking with, and living to God in all religious ſervice, and obedience in matters of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: theſe are works that God requires of his people, and muſt neceſſarily come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that of ſanctification and holineſs; for the inſtitutions of our Lord and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40486:139"/> are holy, they are a part of his holy Will, left recorded in the holy Scripture, and it is a part of our Sanctification, to ſanctifie the Lord in our obedience to him therein, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. It is ſaid of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, that they <hi>were both righteous before God, walking in all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ordinances of God blam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leſly,</hi> that is holily: and ver. 74, 75. <hi>That we being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs before him all the daies of our life,</hi> Rom. 12. 1 Pet. 2. 5, 9. All which Scriptures do preſent us, with the Saints holy ſervice of God in matters of Worſhip. And this part of the Chriſtians holineſs muſt alwaies anſwer the Law and Will of the Law-giver; for God will have his Ordinances and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions to be obſerved by his people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein his Worſhip and his Honour is concerned.</p>
               <p>There are four things too common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, that God and Chriſt will not paſs over without rebuke in the end.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, neglect; when perſons out of ſluggiſhneſs, and unzealous frames of Spirit, do neglect the ſervice and worſhip of God, according to his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, making it a matter of indifferency, ſeeing (as they ſuppoſe) they may be ſaved without any ſuch obſervances; and ſo do not undervalue the wiſdom and will of God, (which is an high degree of iniquity
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40486:140"/> and ſin againſt him,) in omitting and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their duty in his ſervice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But let ſuch know, that look how far ſhort they come in their obedience to Jeſus Chriſt in matters of worſhip, ſo far they come ſhort in holineſs; every breach made in this matter, makes a breach upon ſanctification and holineſs. It's true, all come ſhort in this matter in ſome meaſure, in matter or manner, or both: but when perſons do willingly fail in the matter of Worſhip, that is the great ſin to be willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant, or willingly diſobedient, will not, may not go unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, when perſons change the ordinances of Chriſt, and things of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worſhip, or mix their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therewith; this will he not bear with, though he ſuffer it long, yet it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in the end. When the Lord ordains, and commands one thing, and we reſolve to do another, it's an high act of diſobedience and tranſgreſſion of his Law: the danger thereof ſee, <hi>Iſa. 24. 4, 5, 6. Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>3. When perſons undervalue the holy Ordinances of Chriſt, counting them ſmall things, matter of circumſtance, ſcarce wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be taken notice of, as if there were no matter of Religion, or religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to be had of them; whereas in truth, Chriſt's Church on Earth is viſibly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the World, and falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40486:140"/> only in the matters of Faith and Worſhip, and eſpecially in keeping cloſe to God in the formalities of his Worſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own appointments: an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy ſpirit and principle it is, that doth undervalue the holy, inſtituted Ordinances and Worſhip of the Lord.</p>
               <p>4. When perſons ſet themſelves in direct oppoſition to the will and worſhip of the Lord in his appointments; when they they think it not enough to turn away from the truth of worſhip, and cleave to their own inventions and imaginations, or to the inventions of others, but are inveterated and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mbitterated in their ſpirits againſt the holy Ordinances and Inſtitutions of our Lord, and againſt his people, for worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him therein, and ſo come under that blame, <hi>Hoſ. 8. 12. I have written to him of the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing.</hi> The conſtitution of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, according to new-covenant rule, by the Doctrine of the Goſpel, Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Baptiſm, ſo clearly ſtated in the Goſpel, that he that runs may read, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the contempt and ſcorn of too many who otherwiſe we willingly hope are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It's no wonder for profane men, to profane and blaſpheme the holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, and his people for walking therein: but it behoves all that pretend true godlineſs, to take heed what they do in this matter, and to know, that look how

               <p>The ſecond ſort of holy works are ſuch<note place="margin">2. Such as relate to men.</note> as relate to our walking before, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men; and herein conſiſteth a great part of a Chriſtians holineſs: for God does not only require, and expect his people to walk holily towards him; but likewiſe, that they walk holily, juſtly, and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively towards all men. The truth of this is confirmed by theſe and the like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Mat. 5. 16. Phil. 2. 15, 16. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11, 12. By all which it appears, that it greatly concerns all Chriſtians, (who are ſo indeed) to walk holily before men.</p>
               <p>This holy walking before men, I ſhall mention or diſtinguiſh in five particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed and beware of ſin; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is a truth, that all ſin is againſt God, and on that account ought to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hord of all ſincere ſouls, in love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him; yet we ſhould have reſpect to men in this matter likewiſe, becauſe the glory of God, the honour of Religion, and the ſouls of Sinners are concerned herein; therefore the Lord's people ſhould take heed of, and depart from every evil way, and every evil work. O take heed,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40486:141"/> 
                  <hi>and beware of Covetouſneſs,</hi> Pride, Oppreſſion, Profaneneſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ght behaviour, jeſtings, evil communication, and the like, which will occaſion men to reproach, and harden them againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to their own deſtruction. Thus men profeſſing godlineſs, not only ſin againſt God and wrong their own ſouls, bring diſhonour to Religion, but the guilt of the damnation of poor ſinners upon themſelves, hardening them in their evil waies, by their bad example. O conſider this all ye that pretend to be religious, and have not conſcience to God in this matter: ſee <hi>Rom. 2. 23, 24. Phil.</hi> 3. 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To walk juſtly and righteouſly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, in all civil and worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments: Chriſtians ſhould be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious and careful in this matter, that no unjuſt or unrighteous thing be done by them, but to keep to that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rule, <hi>As ye would that men ſhould do to you, ſo do ye to them.</hi> If this rule were ſincerely followed, it would prevent many miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages on this account; and this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that perſons who can for worldly advantage do wrong, defraud, or oppreſs others, have very great cauſe to ſuſpect their own ſincerity in the great things of the Goſpel; for he that is <hi>unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the leaſt,</hi> is not faithful in the greateſt. This of Iniuſtice and Oppreſſion is that the Lord complains of, and diſlikes in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple throughout all his miniſtrations both
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40486:142"/> in Law and Goſpel; and it is that which is directly contrary to the holy Law of God, and indeed to the law of Nature; therefore let not ſuch perſons who can gripe and grind, defraud and oppreſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, in counting themſelves of the number of the holy ones of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An holy walk before men is an inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive walk; that is, to give no juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offence by any means, in any thing, unleſs it come to paſs, (as it too often doth) that ignorant and fooliſh men will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at holineſs, and the worſhip of God: in ſuch caſe we ought rather to diſpleaſe men than God, and rather to pleaſe God than men, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19. &amp; 5. 29. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. But in caſes wherein we may without ſin againſt God, and wrong to our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, we may, yea we ought to walk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſively, <hi>Rom. 12. 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 32, 33. And wilful breach in this matter, is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of Chriſt, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing: and I fear there is much of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs in too many profeſſing people in this matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. An holy walk is a peaceable, holy walk with men; this is the law of the Goſpel, <hi>As much as in you lieth, live peaceable with all men; and follow peace with all men, and holineſs,</hi> &amp;c. The Law of God is holy, and it's the great part of our holineſs to live to it; and unpeaceable, froward perſons cannot well be accounted an holy perſon: a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40486:142"/> wonderful miſtake it is in perſons, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of holineſs, make a breach of peace on unſound and ungrounded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: when it may be, theſe very notions on which the breach is made, (when rightly examined) are unholy notions, without all footing in the law of Chriſt: and thus, through the ſlight of the ſubtil Adverſary, is unholineſs ſhrowded under the name of holineſs; it behoves all ſerious ſouls en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared with this evil, to conſider it in time, and to repent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. An holy walk, and holy works, are works of Charity, and doing the will of Chriſt, in doing good to men; <hi>Gal. 6. 10. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, eſpecially to them who are of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> In this Chriſtians ſhould be like their Lord, of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>he went about doing good,</hi> Acts 10. 38. And truly, as good works are a part of the Chriſtians holineſs, ſo are they the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted concommitants of Faith; for the Faith that is without the works of the Goſpel, is a dead Faith: and this is the charge given to thoſe that are <hi>rich in this World,</hi> to be rich in good works, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Tit.</hi> 6. 17, 18. And that <hi>thoſe that have believed in God, to be careful to maintain good Works; theſe things are good and profitable to men,</hi> Tit. 3. 8. Not to God, he needs them not, <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 2. &amp; 35. 7. But good works are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to men, <hi>i. e.</hi> to thoſe that are ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40486:143"/> exerciſed therein. 1. They prove the truth and ſincerity of their Faith and Love, for without it the Faith is naught, and the Love is of the ſame nature; it's none of the Faith and Love of the Goſpel that is without the works of the Goſpel, <hi>Jam. 2. 14, 18. 2 Cor. 8. 8. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. &amp; 3. 14, 17, 18. He that pretends to have the Faith and Love of the Goſpel, without the works of the Goſpel, deceives himſelf; <hi>Jam. 1. 22. Be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It will make for their account in the day of account; for we muſt all expect to give an account in the great day of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. And the good works of the Saints ſhall be rewarded at that day, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 20, 21, 22, 23. &amp; <hi>ver. 34, 35, 36. 1 Tit. 6. 17, 18. Rev.</hi> 22. 14. Only this, it behoves us to beware of Popiſh meritorious works, deſerving any thing, either in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or Salvation, but it's all of Grace.</p>
               <p>In this note three things; 1. That Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are put into a capacity of doing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable works, only by Grace, renewed, juſtified, and accepted in perſon and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, only by Grace, through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>2. That being put into this ſaved eſtate, and capacity of doing acceptable works in the Lord Jeſus, it is expected that they live to God herein, and are faithful in that high and holy Calling: this is it unto which
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40486:143"/> they were created in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph. 2. 10. For we are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto good works, which God hath before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that we ſhould walk in them:</hi> and this the Grace of Chriſt (where it is in truth) <hi>teacheth, Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. And they are in Scripture account, graceleſs perſons, that are void of good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>3. God will give rewards to his people according to their works; not that the works are the meritorious cauſe of reward, for ſo it cannot be, becauſe all the works of the Saints, as done by them, are imperfect, and mixed with ſin, and ſo in themſelves can deſerve nothing but condemnation: but, as accepted in the beloved, ſo are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as perfect, and ſhall have as full a reward as if they were perfect, ſo that the reward is ſtill of Grace: It's Grace that God will crown the imperfect works of his people (done in ſincerity of Faith and Love) with Glory: and ſutable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and labour of love in the Lord's work, ſhall the reward be diſpenced, <hi>Matt. 25. 20, 21, 22, 23. Luke</hi> 19. 16, to 19. 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 41, 42. Matt.</hi> 19. 27, 28, 29. And the ſuffering Saints, for the name and ſake of Chriſt, are like to have the greateſt ſhare in the Glory to come, <hi>Luke 6. 22, 23. 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 13. A wonderful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement ſhould it be to the Saints, both in doing and ſuffering the will of the Lord, they ſhall ſuffer no loſs at all by it,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40486:144"/> but great advantage for encouragement in the way and works of the Lord, both in doing and ſuffering his will, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 58. Heb. 5. 10. Rom.</hi> 2. 7. 10. And they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the ſouls and bodies of others, they are relieved and refreſhed thereby, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 12. Philem. ver.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Thus have I endeavoured to give a brief touch to this great matter of Sanctification and good Works; with the great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all godly perſons to walk therein. The truth is, (I fear) that as the Papiſts, and Popiſhly affected, make too much of of them, in looking on them as merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and their Saviours; ſo the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants run far on the other hand, under the notion of being all for Faith, and ſo have been, and are too little for works. But I hope the Reader will lay this matter to heart, and not content himſelf with any Faith ſhort of this holy working Faith. And O that every that nameth the name of Jeſus in truth, would ſhew themſelves Chriſtians on this account, in an exemplary walking in the works of the Goſpel. Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Chriſtians ſhould be examples to the weaker; and elder Chriſtians ſhould be examples to the younger; and eſpecially ſhould Miniſters be examples and patterns to the Saints, they ſhould ſhine forth not only in Doctrine, but in Life; they ſhould be patterns in love, humility, meekneſs, patience, holineſs, and every good work;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40486:144"/> examples <hi>in Word, in Spirit, in Converſation, and Doctrine;</hi> that ſo the Goſpel be not blamed, nor God diſhonoured, nor Men juſtly offended, 1 <hi>Theſ. 2. 10. 1 Tit.</hi> 4. 12. And thus ſhould both Miniſter and people prize and preſs after holineſs, within, and without, becauſe <hi>holineſs becometh the houſe of God for ever,</hi> and thereby he is glorified; and ſuch are manifeſted to be in the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way of Salvation; for <hi>

By all which it appears, that knowledg which is ſaving, differs but
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40486:146"/> little from Faith, and includes Faith.</p>
               <p>Now in as much as knowledg, or illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination<note place="margin">Difference between ſaving knowledg, and that which is not.</note> is common to all where the true light ſhines, <hi>i. e.</hi> to hypocrites and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, as well as ſincere Chriſtians, as <hi>Heb. 6. 4. 6. &amp; 10. 32. 2. 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21. Rom. 2. 17, 18. 21, 22. 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 1, 2. I ſhall therefore rather apply my ſelf to ſpeak ſomething to ſhew the difference between the ſaving knowledg of God and Chriſt in the new covenant of his Grace, and that which men may have, and yet be ſhort of Grace and Life; referring the Reader to Chap. 1. for the diſtinct knowledg of God.</p>
               <p>The firſt difference is, the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg<note place="margin">1. It is a ſoul-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</note> of God and Chriſt, is a ſoul-humbling ſelf-abaſing knowledg: and that in the firſt work of Converſion, the very entrance of ſaving knowledg, gives the ſoul ſuch a ſight and apprehenſion of God, and of Chriſt, and of himſelf and ſin, that it throws down, and lays low the ſoul, and makes him cry out as thoſe. <hi>Acts 2. 37. Being pricked at the heart,</hi> with the light of truth: they underſtood and believed what they did not before, both concerning Chriſt and themſelves: <hi>They cried out, men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> How wonderfully was the caſe changed? they who but a little before, cried out, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him,</hi> now are pricked at the heart for it, and cry another cry, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Sutable to this is that, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 130.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40486:146"/> 
                  <hi>The entrance of thy Word giveth light, it giveth underſtanding to the ſimple.</hi> The very entrance of the Word of Life into the heart, giveth this light; the ſoul comes thereby to know ſomething of God, of his Holineſs, of his Juſtice, and Goodneſs; and ſomething of himſelf, of his own badneſs, unholineſs, ſinfulneſs, and need of mercy; and this amaſeth and abaſeth the ſoul; and if the work be right, this ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abaſing is not only in the ſight and ſenſe of ſome one particular ſin, or particular ſins, but it gives a ſight of the body of death, that is, of the ſinful nature, that there is nothing but ſin, a ſinful ſtate, the thoughts and imaginations, the words and works; yea, that the beſt works (as done by us) are <hi>menstruous and filthy.</hi> A ſoul never right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows himſelf, till he thus know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and the want of this is the cauſe of ſo many abortives in Religion, that comes to nothing. Perſons may meet with ſome convictions of, and converſion from ſome particular ſin, or ſins, but never ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves utterly loſt, and undone, and filthy all over; and ſuch converſions ordinarily firſt or laſt comes to nothing: not but that the beginning work oft-times may ariſe from conviction of ſome capital iniquity, as thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. But if ſaving, it leaves not till it diſcover the body of death: this is the effect of ſaving knowledg; or if it meet with, and ſteal in by degrees on
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40486:147"/> thoſe that have lived under good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and uſe of means, that it makes not ſo great a noiſe at firſt. This muſt be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected firſt or laſt, the knowledg of God in Chriſt Jeſus, in the way of the Goſpel, and of themſelves, to know themſelves to be indeed wretched, and miſerable, without which they never rightly imbrace Chriſt, and the Grace and Mercy of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>And this ſelf-humbling, ſelf-abaſing, and ſelf and ſin-abhorring frame, is not only a work for a day, <hi>i. e.</hi> at firſt conviction, but where the true light ſhineth, it abideth; and gracious growing Chriſtians, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they live, and the higher they grow in Goſpel light, the more they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the more they abaſe themſelves, have little and low thoughts of themſelves. This is that which ſincere Chriſtians do and can experience; ſee witneſſes from Scripture of this truth, David, <hi>a man after God's own heart,</hi> though a King, when he danced before the Ark, and withal his wife mocked him, he ſaid, <hi>I will yet be more vile than this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and baſe in my own ſight.</hi> By which we may ſee, that this is the common work of God in all gracious ſouls; Greatneſs nor Kingſhip did hinder: it laies low the ſouls of Great men and Kings, where it is in power; <hi>Job 40. 4. I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth,</hi> &amp;c. And Chap. 42. 5. 6. <hi>I have heard
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40486:147"/> of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> The more a ſoul knows of God and Chriſt, the more he abhors himſelf; not only an abhorrency of ſin, but of ſelf, becauſe of ſin, attends gracious knowing perſons, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 5. That Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Prophet cries out, <hi>Wo is me, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, I am a man of unclean lips, &amp;c. For mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> He had ſeen King Jeſus, it was a Goſpel ſight which did thus humble and abaſe him, <hi>Joh. 12. 41. Theſe things ſaid</hi> Iſaiah <hi>when he ſaw his glory, and ſpake of him.</hi> It was the glory mentioned in this Chapter, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt alludes unto. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, the fore-runner of our Lord, of whom he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, that he was greater both in light and work, than the greateſt Prophet, yet he had this frame of ſpirit in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. When they ſent to him to know who he was, <hi>he confeſſed, and denied not that he was not the Chriſt; He it is, who coming after me, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before me, whoſe ſhooes latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe,</hi> ver. 20. 27. Not worthy to do the meaneſt ſervice for him. So the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>Rom. 7. 18. I know that in me (that is, in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing:</hi> and hence he cries out, ver. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> And confeſſeth himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. To be <hi>the leaſt of the Apoſtles, not meet to be called an

               <p>But the common head-knowledg that hypocrites and formaliſts attain unto, is a ſoul-exalting, and ſelf-boaſting knowledg, it puffs up, and makes them proud, and ſelf-conceited; they ſwell with their own good eſteem of themſelves, they think themſelves beſt, and every one worſe than themſelves: he ſaith as the Phariſee, <hi>Lord, I thank thee, I am not like other men.</hi> Not but that it is the duty of gracious ſouls to be thankful for God's gracious work in them, as well as for his benefits beſtowed on them.

But this ſelf-abaſing, and ſoul-humbling knowledg, if far from the tabernacle of the hypocrite; ſelf-boaſting, and ſelf-glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the fruit of the fleſh; and indeed, whatever ſuch perſons pretend to know, yet they are in truth ignorant; did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons know themſelves as they are, (which they can never rightly do without the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of Grace) they would ſee cauſe enough in themſelves to abaſe themſelves; but ignorance is the cauſe of pride, that is it the Apoſtle intends, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 2. If any man thinketh that he knoweth any thing, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40486:148"/> nothing as he ought to know:</hi> that is, he that thinketh of his knowledg, ſo as to be puffed up, grows proud, and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited therewith; ſuch a one <hi>knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as he ought to know:</hi> in which it's clear, that ignorance is the cauſe of pride, and puffings up; he that knoweth moſt, being puffed up, knoweth nothing as he ought to know.</p>
               <p>But here I would mind a word further, leſt any gracious ſoul, by this, ſhould fall into temptation, we are to know, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledg may be attended with the ſame temptation of pride and puffings up; not that it flows from knowledg, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ignorance, and eſpecially from fleſhly corruption, there being the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all ſin in the nature of the Saints; and that is it the Apoſtle intends, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 1. Knowledg puffeth up, but love edifieth.</hi> He ſpeaks there of the knowledg of good men, as well as bad; for it differs not in the formality or kind thereof, as ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, relating to the things known or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; it differs rather in the manner of the work, than in the matter, for the moſt part: for, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We all have knowledg, knowledg puffeth up.</hi> Even ſuch knowledg as the Apoſtle had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as we all have: not (as I ſaid before) that knowledg in it ſelf puffeth up, if ſaving, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but it's the baſe fleſh, corruption of nature, that takes an advantage there-from
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40486:149"/> to be puffed up: the Saints having the root of all ſin in them, and ſo of pride, as of worldlineſs, and other like ſins; and are liable to puffings up, as the Hypocrites. Experience teacheth this, and the Apoſtle had the ſame experience, as is manifeſt, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. Lest I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, through the abundance of revelations,</hi> &amp;c. The holy Apoſtle was in danger of this ſelf-boaſting, through his abundance of revelations and knowledg: hence he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 27. I keep under my body, and bring it in ſubjection, leſt by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt away.</hi> Such is the baſeneſs and corruption of nature, even in the Saints, as to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelf, and puffed up in heavenly light and knowledg.</p>
               <p>The difference then between the ſincere ſoul and the hypocrite is, the ſincere heart that lives in light, doth not only know God and Chriſt in ſome meaſure, but himſelf; and ſo eſpies theſe fleſhly motions and workings to ſelf-exaltations and puffings up, and ſo judges it, and abhors it as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable thing; watches it, and wars againſt it, as againſt any other iniquity.</p>
               <p>But the meerly notional head profeſſor and hypocrite, he pleaſeth himſelf in it, it is his life, his glory, ſelf-glorying is his higheſt attainment; and ſo his life, all his receptions of light hath not brought him out of ſelf, he ſeeks himſelf, and glorieth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40486:149"/> in his ſelf-attainments, and lives therein with pleaſure; he preacheth for himſelf, and prayeth, and diſcourſeth, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for himſelf; and ſo he lives in ſelf, as his Element, as the fiſh lives in the water; all his light and knowledg worketh him not out of himſelf, if he attain but to a ſhew of humility; he is proud, and puffed up therewith, for ſuch may attain <hi>to a ſhew of humility, and be va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Prophet prayeth, <hi>Give me understanding, that I may know thy Precepts,</hi> ver. 127. <hi>I love thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments above Gold, above fine God; therefore I eſteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every falſe way.</hi> This is true knowledg that affects the heart with love to, and delight in the Lord and hatred againſt all things that is contrary to him. Saving knowledg affects the heart with God, and exalts God and Chriſt above all, and hath low and contemptible thoughts of the World, and all things here below, looks upon it as it is, to be all but <hi>vanity, and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> So the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi>

And as it is an heart-affecting, and an heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delighting knowledg, it affects the heart with God and Chriſt, and the things that concern his Name and Goſpel; ſo is it an heart-transforming and changing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, it leaves not ſouls carnal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vain and ſinful, as they were before; no, but it changes thoſe in whom it is, it very much effects what God requires, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds,</hi> &amp;c. And thus ſaving knowledg effects, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of God, are changed,</hi> &amp;c. The knowledg of God and Chriſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is of a changing nature, it works thoſe in whom it is, into the image and likeneſs of Chriſt, which is God's deſign in the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 48, 49. It accompliſheth the work of Sanctification, and an holy conformity to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Saving knowledg reacheth the heart, it's exerciſed about heart-work; it humbles the heart, it changes the heart, it glads the heart, it conforms the heart, and ſo the whole man to the will of Chriſt; all that the underſtanding receives, it immediately conveys to the heart: the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40486:150"/> ſavingly inlightned by the Word and Spirit, conveys light and love to the heart. In this way <hi>the love of Chriſt is ſhed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit;</hi> Rom. 5. 5. 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God, in the face of Ieſus Christ.</hi> God's new-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-light ſhines not only into the head, but likewiſe into the heart, making an heart-change, and working heart-love, and heart-obedience, and giving heart-conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: it works heart-hatred of ſin, and heart-performance of duty, <hi>Pſ. 37. 31. The Law of God is in his heart, none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide;</hi> that is, it is in his heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God, to love God, and obey him as far as he knoweth, and is willing to know more, that he may do it: he prayeth with the Prophet, <hi>Pſ. 119. 33. Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end.</hi> The truly knowing ſoul accounts nothing well done, in which the heart is not; believes with the heart, loves with the heart, obeys with the heart, hates ſin with the heart, rejoyces in the Lord with the heart; in a word, what-ever ſuch a ſoul doth, <hi>he doth it heartily, as to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40486:151"/> ſo far as to affect the heart indeed with God and Chriſt, his Word and Will, his Precepts and Promiſes; he goes no further (at beſt) than that Church, <hi>Rev. 3. 1. I know thy works, that thou haſt a name, that thou liveſt, and art dead:</hi> Dead while alive, and ſuch mens works are dead works, and dead ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, with all their knowledg, they are not changed, but remain the ſame, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtill, and carnal, and proud ſtill, and vain, and like the World ſtill, no true non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts to the World; it's to be feared that there is too much of this ſort of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg among Profeſſors, that will at laſt leave them where it found them, <hi>i. e. in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity.</hi>

               <p>The knowledg of the hypocrite dwells moſt in the head, it is ſwimming-brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, and runs into the tongue, and it may be into ſome form of profeſſion, but ſinks not into the heart, it makes no change there, works not the heart <hi>after God;</hi> come to Chriſt's Ordinances they may, and make profeſſion of his Name, but <hi>their hearts are after their covetouſneſs;</hi> the world hath their hearts be-ſure, where-ever their perſons are; ſo that word is fulfilled in them, <hi>

Not to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or fearful of the Fiery Furnace, <hi>Our God, whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us out of thine hand, O King:</hi> they knew Gods all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and there they truſt, and leave the iſſue to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>But head-knowledg, or the knowledg of the hypocrite, whatever it talks yet, it never works a ſoul truly to truſt in God <hi>at all times,</hi> nor truly at any time; there may be a ſuppoſition of truſting ſometimes, but when the difficulty comes, the ſoul ſtarts aſide from God to ſome ſecondary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful way of deliverance, like thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 13. But the ſoul that

What time I am afraid I will truſt in thee;</hi> that is the time eſpecially to truſt in God, in time of need: this was it kept up the heart of the Apoſtle in all his temptations, 2 <hi>Tit. 1. 12. Nevertheleſs I am not aſhamed, for I know whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> (or truſted) <hi>and am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know his goodneſs, faithfulneſs, and all-ſufficiency, and that makes me truſt him with body and ſoul, I commit all to him, and to his keeping unto that day: thus knowing ſouls are truſting ſouls, <hi>Pſal. 52. 8.

               </p>
               <p>Heart-knowledg deſigns heart-obedience to the Lord, <hi>ver. 10.

That his people did faſt for themſelves,</hi> and eat and drink for themſelves; whereas gracious ſouls, who live in light, ſhould do all for God, eat and drink for him, that they may live to him, perform every duty for him, that he may be glorified, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 31.

The reaſon is, becauſe they have received from the Lord of his teachings; their hearts are filled with his divine knowledg; and it may be ſo ſometimes, that there needs skill in the learner to draw it forth, ſome having learned that leſſon to <hi>be ſlow to ſpeak, and ſlow to wrath, and ſwift to hear:</hi> and that, <hi>Prov. 14. 33.

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Of the Divine Virtue and Grace of Love to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE choice Virtue of Grace of Love, which alwaies accompanieth true Knowledg and Faith, is as the oile to the wheels, that makes the ſoul <hi>as the Chariots of Aminadab,</hi> to run ſwiftly, and perform every duty relating both to God and man chearfully and willingly; the Lord loves willing and hearty ſervice, and that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be, unleſs it flows from the truth of love to God, as well as conſcience and duty to him.</p>
               <p>This duty and virtue of love, muſt be, 1. and chiefly to God and Chriſt above all. 2. To his people for his ſake. 3. To all men, to enemies as well as to friends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To God and Chriſt, as our chiefeſt<note place="margin">1. To God and Chriſt.</note> good, as there are many excellent and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful new-covenant Gifts and Virtues, being accompanied with love; yet love is the moſt excellent of all Gifts, and of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues next to Faith; and the Apoſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it beyond Faith, that is, that Faith which is without love: there may be (and I fear is) much Faith without love, which
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40486:157"/> will fail in the end: but Goſpel-love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without Faith; for where truth of love is to God and Chriſt, there is Faith: for no man can love him on whom he doth not believe; but men may have Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Love, therefore he prefers Love above Faith, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 2. And though I have all Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and have not Charity,</hi> (that is love) <hi>I am nothing:</hi> the word <hi>all Faith,</hi> not only intends the Faith of miracle, for that is but one ſort of Faith, but all Faith in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of it, though not in the power and life; for if there were not Faith in the Doctrine, ordinarily there could not be the Faith of miracle, as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21, 22. Though ſaving Faith is alwaies accompanied with the truth of Love, and a meaſure of all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Virtues of the Goſpel, <hi>ver. 13. Now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity; but the greateſt of theſe is Charity.</hi> So <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle having mentioned ſeveral choice duties and Virtues, ſaith, <hi>And above all theſe things put on Charity, which is the bond of Perfection;</hi> or the perfect bond, by all which it appears, that Love, Charity, is a moſt choice and ſingular Virtue, and deſirable for Chriſtians to be priſing and preſſing after.</p>
               <p>What Love is in general; Love is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<note place="margin">A deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Love.</note> of the ſoul fixed upon, cleaving to, and delighting in ſomething wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends ſome ſpecial worth and good; thus it is in natural Love, and thus it is in ſpiritual Love; for there is a natural, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40486:157"/> there is a ſpiritual Love: the ſecond it is I am ſpeaking of; and the difference is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be diſcerned in the object than in the root or principle, that being a Divine ſecret, the riſe whence Divine Virtues flow from the ſecret and hidden work of the Spirit of Grace; yet the Spirit propounds to us the diſtinction rather by the object than the principle from whence it flows: it lets us to know, that if our love fix ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely on the right objects, then it flows from the right principle: ſo then, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral love fixes on natural and worldly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, from natural cauſes; ſo that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love that fixes on ſpiritual objects; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural love never looks ſo high as God, and Chriſt, and Glory, to fix there.</p>
               <p>So then this is ſpiritual love that fixeth upon, cleaveth to, and delighteth in God, and Chriſt, in Grace, and Glory, as its chiefeſt and moſt ſpecial good: and this is certain, that we can never love God as we ought, and as doth concern us, unleſs we apprehend him to be our chiefeſt and moſt eſpecial good. <hi>Matt. 22. 37. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy ſoul, and with all thy heart, and with all thy mind;</hi> which we can never do, unleſs we prize him above all other good in the World; and ſo of <hi>Chriſt: Matt. 10. 37, 38, 39. He that loveth Father or Mother, Son or Daughter, or Life more than me, he is not worthy of me.</hi> Which no ſoul can attain to, but by being inſtructed into the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40486:158"/> tranſcending worth of Jeſus Chriſt: this could the Prophet ſay, <hi>Pſal. 73. 25. Whom have I in Heaven but thee; and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee:</hi> and the Spouſes ſong, 5. 10. <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand:</hi> and Paul, Phil. 3. 8. <hi>Yea doubtleſs, I do account all things but loſs for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I might win Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. And this is that which every ſoul that loves the Lord Jeſus in truth and ſincerity can ſay: ſo that if you love God and Chriſt above all, you do then eſteem him as your chiefeſt good, as your alone portion; you do undervalue every thing here below; you can look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every thing here below to be <hi>but vanity, yea, vanity of vanities:</hi> Eccl. 1. 2. <hi>Vanity of vanities, (ſaith the Preacher) Vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all is vanity:</hi> this doubling and trebling of its vanity, argues it to be exceeding vain, little, and contemptible to the ſoul that loves Chriſt, in compariſon of him; ſouls that have ſeen into, and taſted of the goodneſs of the Lord, and the excellency of Divine things, can ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Lam. 3. 24. The Lord is my portion ſaith my ſoul, therefore will I hope in him.</hi>

The worldling hath his mind taken up with the world, runs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his profit, and ſeeks after his gain from every quarter; and when it goes well on that account, all is well; he troubles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as little as may be about things of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine concernment; but the gracious ſoul <hi>preſſeth hard after God, Pſ. 63. 8. My ſoul</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>preſſeth hard after thee.</hi> As the worldling preſſeth hard after the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is his portion, his all, his chiefeſt good: ſo does the ſoul that loves God as his portion, follow hard after him, that it may know him more, and enjoy him more; his meditations are daily of him; he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems his <hi>loving kindneſs better than life,</hi> and therefore his ſoul is ſet upon him: <hi>Pſ. 104. My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the Lord;</hi> ſo that in a word, where your minds are moſt ſet, and moſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and what you moſt priſe, there you
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40486:159"/> love moſt, and beſt; <hi>For where your treaſure is, there will be your hearts alſo,</hi> Mat. 6. 21. O how few that profeſs Chriſtianity, can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their hearts to God in this matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you love God above all, as your<note place="margin">2. You will love his things.</note> chiefeſt good, you will love his things, whatever hath his ſtamp upon it; I mean on the ſpiritual account, you love it, and prize it for his ſake.</p>

O how I love thy Law, it is my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation all the day;</hi> ver. 103. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte, yea ſweeter than honey to my mouth.</hi> This is a ſpecial property of a ſoul that loves the Lord, to love his Word, and to delight therein, to ſuck ſweetneſs there-from: <hi>ver. 72. The law of thy mouth is better to me than thouſands of Gold and Silver.</hi> Well, by this you may know, if you love the Lord, you do love his Word, his Will, his Precepts, his Promiſes, it's all precious to you, and your meditation is much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; <hi>ver.</hi> 97. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1. 2.

It's a great miſtake in perſons who pretend to love the Word of God, but do not love to do it; ſuch perſons deceive themſelves; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> This was the voice of the Law, and this is the voice of the Goſpel; <hi>Exod. 20. 6. Shewing mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thouſands of them that love me, and keep my Commandments.</hi> God never did, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will accept any ſervice but that which is done in love to him; and he ever did, and will, accept of thoſe who love, ſerve, and obey him according to his Word and Will: and if you ſerve him in love, his Commandments will be pleaſant to you. 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 3. This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments, and his Commandments are not grievous.</hi> Then we love God, when we keep his Commandments, and they are pleaſant to us, and not grievous: and if in this ſpirit of love, you live to, and obey the Lord, he will meet with you, and your ſouls ſhall meet with him, and have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him: <hi>Iſa. 64. 5. Joh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. Read thoſe Scriptures at your leaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you love Chriſt, you do love what<note place="margin">3.

Ye that love the Lord, hate evil; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the ſouls of his Saints, he delivereth them
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40486:160"/> out of the hands of the wicked;</hi> i. e. Though the wicked hate and perſecute the Saints for their hating and forſaking the waies of the wicked; yet let thoſe that love the Lord, have evil ſtill; for God will deliver them out of the hands of the wicked, that do hate them for their hating of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. O therefore, ye that love the Lord, hate evil, and love goodneſs; <hi>Amos 5. 15. Hate the evil, and love the good,</hi> &amp;c. This is that which God loves; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 7. And Chriſt loves; <hi>Pſal. 40. 7. Heb. 1. 9. Thou hast loved righteouſneſs, and hated wickedneſs; wherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oile of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi> Do you love God and Chriſt above all, then ſhew it in this way; <hi>Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good:</hi> it is to be feared, that moſt that bear the name of Chriſtian in the World, do in truth hate that which God loves, and love that which he hates; an infallible diſcovery that the love of God is not in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe who love the Lord, do love<note place="margin">4. They love his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> his appearing, and long to be with him; ſurely thoſe who talk of love to Chriſt, but care not to be with him, deſire not his coming, that they might more fully enjoy him; do but talk of love, it is love but <hi>in word and tongue,</hi> not in deed and truth: if the Bride pretend love to the Bridegroom, but deſire not the Marriage-day, could be content if that never come, it argues but
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40486:160"/> little or no love, ſutable to ſuch a relation. If the Wife pretend love to her Husband, and when he is gone from home, care not where ever he do return, it's but little ſign of love: ſo, for ſouls to talk of love to Chriſt, but deſire not the enjoyment of him in the neareſt relation, do but deceive themſelves; they have ground to fear their love is not right; they will be content to go to him, and to enjoy him, when there is no remedy, when they muſt go to him, or to a worſe place, and to worſe company: I fear this is the caſe of moſt who think and ſay they love Chriſt; the truth of this, that they who love Chriſt, do love his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, that they may be with him. See 2 <hi>Tit. 4. 7, 8. Tit. 1. 13. Heb. 9. 28. Rev.</hi> 22. 20.

Our love to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren muſt be of the ſame nature as it is to God; becauſe, if we love rightly, it muſt be for his ſake. And ſurely we cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally imagine that God will accept of hypocritical love, word-love, tongue-love, love in ſhew, feigned love, no, God abhors it, and ſo ſhould men. <hi>Rom. 12. 9.

As the greateſt ſhew of love, if it be not for his ſake, is not accounted of with him; ſo the leaſt act of love for his ſake ſhall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe that where little acts of love are for his ſake, greater acts will be, if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and ability concur.</p>

When perſons are ſo much bound up in their ſpirits, that they with ſo much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty forgive their brethren on their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it's a ſign they live not in the ſenſe of the need they have of forgiveneſs from God themſelves; and may juſtly doubt whether they are made partakers of the forgiveneſs of the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 12. 14, 15.

               <p>7. True love to the Saints is then right<note place="margin">7. It muſt be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, to all Saints.</note> when it is univerſal, to all Saints, as well to one as to another, as well to the poor as to the rich, and as well to the rich as to the poor; to a poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as to a rich and royal <hi>David;</hi> to an afflicted <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as to an admired <hi>Solomon:</hi> if love be right, it is no reſpecter of perſons; <hi>For he that reſpecteth perſons, will tranſgreſs for a piece of bread:</hi> that is, upon any occaſion will wreſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this love is rare to be found, rich profeſſors will love them that are rich,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40486:164"/> and undervalue the poor, make them their foot-ſtool; and too often the poor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the rich, becauſe they are rich, have an evil eye upon the riches of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, becauſe themſelves are poor: but the love of the Lords people is (or ſhould be) one to another for the Lord's ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are his, and ſo ſhould be to the weak as to the ſtrong, to the poor as to the rich; partial love is no true love. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 1, 2. It is the commendation the Apoſtle gives the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that their love was <hi>to all the Saints; Eph. 1. 15. Col.</hi> 1. 4. It's a choice diſcovery of Divine love, when it hath no reſpect of perſons, but fixes on the object purely for ſpiritual cauſes, for Holineſs, for the image and Grace of Chriſt: the pooreſt Saints are as nigh to God, as rich in Grace and Glory as the richeſt: <hi>Jam. 2. 5. Hearken my beloved Brethren, hath not God choſen the poor of this World, rich in Faith, and heirs of that Kingdom, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that love him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Yet, if it be divine and true, it runs<note place="margin">8. It is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the cauſes of love.</note> out ſutable to the cauſes of love; for though true love be univerſal, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, yet it is not blind, but fixes moſt where it apprehends moſt of God, moſt of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Humility, Love, and conſtancy in the way and work of the Lord: for this is certain, that if we love for Godlineſs ſake, where we ſee moſt of Godlineſs, and the image of Chriſt, there we love moſt; and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40486:164"/> this need not be ſtated as a duty, for it is the property of true Grace and Love ſo to do: we have Chriſt our Lord for example in this matter, who had his beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple above the reſt; <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 23. &amp; 20. 2. &amp; 21. 20, 24. Not but that he loved all, and ſo muſt we love all the Lord's people with the ſame love, although there may, and will be degrees therein: <hi>Pſal. 16. 2, 3. My goodneſs extendeth not unto thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi> So did <hi>Paul</hi> prize and prefer <hi>Timothy</hi> above all the reſt of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters with him, for the excellency of ſpirit that was in him; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 29. 20, 21, 22. And on this account a poor Saint may have more ſpiritual cauſe of love in him than a rich one; he that is poor in the World, may be rich in Grace; and a rich Saint in the World may be rich in Grace, and have more cauſe of ſpiritual love than ſome that are poor: not but that all that are truly gracious, are ſpiritually rich in Grace; yet God giveth differingly as he pleaſeth; and there are differing capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and improvings of what is given: but this is certain, that faithful improvement ſhall have addition and increaſe.</p>
               <p>9. And laſtly, True love to the Saints is<note place="margin">9 They love conſtantly.</note> conſtant love, not by fits and good moods, ſometimes love, and ſometimes hate; like the Religion of ſome, who under convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or afflictions, will be very religious,

It's true, Saints under ſin muſt be reproved, and ſo it may be, that ſome ſtrangedneſs may be requiſite, yet love muſt ſtill continue: <hi>Gal. 6. 1, 2. Heb. 13. 1.

               <head>CHAP. XX. Of the Goſpel-fear of God.</head>
               <p>THE fear of God is one (and not the leaſt) of the Divine and ſaving Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the new Covenant, and planted in every gracious heart; it is a part of the new Covenant Law written in the heart, abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, as other new Covenant Virtues are, and is included in that Faith to which the promiſe is made.</p>
               <p>The fear of God is of that worth and weight, that it is impoſſible for a truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul to be without it; it is a ſpecial character of a graceleſs perſon that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; <hi>Rom. 3. 18. There is no fear of God before their eyes.</hi> In ſpeaking to this, I ſhall mind three things; 1. That it is a Virtue of the new Covenant, and neceſſary to be in the hearts of all Believers. 2. What it is. 3. The uſefulneſs and profitableneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>1. That it is a Virtue of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">1. It is a Virtue of the new Covenant.</note> and neceſſary to be written in the hearts of all true Believers. And this will appear, if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a promiſe of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; <hi>Jer. 32. 39. And I will give them one
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40486:172"/> heart, and one way, that they may fear me;</hi> ver. 40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Which is a promiſe of the new and everlaſting Covenant, the ſame as is expreſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. 31, to 34, And is applied to the Goſpel by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. Where God promiſeth to <hi>write his Law in the heart,</hi> that is, to ſeaſon the heart with a diſpoſition to believe, love, fear, and obey the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is that Virtue with which Chriſt our Lord was eminently filled, and therefore certainly it is neceſſary for his members to be ſeaſoned therewith: <hi>Iſa. 11. 2. And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the praiſe-worthy Virtue of the Saints, commended throughout all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 3. It's ſaid, that <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah feared the Lord greatly:</hi> the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of follows, <hi>ver. 4. Neh.</hi> 7. 2. It's ſaid, that <hi>Hanani feared God above many; for which</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah <hi>gave him the charge over</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>Job</hi> is deſcribed to have this Virtue, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 8. To be <hi>an upright man, and one that feared
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40486:173"/> God;</hi> and ver. 1. <hi>One that feared God, and eſchewed evil.</hi> Mal. 2. 4, 5. God made his Covenant <hi>with</hi> Levy, <hi>of Life and Peace; for the fear wherewith he feared me, and he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid before my Name.</hi> It is the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches, in a time of liberty, that <hi>they walked in the fear of the Lord;</hi> Acts 9. 31.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is that the Lords people are frequently exhorted to, both in the old and new Teſtament; by which it appears, that it is a duty as well as a Virtue; <hi>Lev. 19. 14. But ſhalt fear thy God, I am the Lord;</hi> and 25. 17. <hi>But thou ſhalt fear thy God, for I am the Lord thy God.</hi> Deut. 13. 4. <hi>Ye ſhall walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord your God, and fear him.</hi> Eccl. 12. 13. <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> Deut. 6. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him, and ſwear by his Name.</hi> Luke 12. 4, 5. <hi>And I ſay unto you, my friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Apoſtle exhorteth the Saints to be <hi>perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> By all which it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appears, that to fear God is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial duty of every true Chriſtian; 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 17. Rev. 14. 7. Heb. 12. 28. Let us have Grace, that we may ſerve God with Reverence and Godly fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:40486:173"/>5. It's that Virtue which includes part, yea, a great part of the Goſpel; becauſe where the fear of the Lord is, there is Faith, Love, Humility, and Obedience; even the whole terms of Goſpel-intereſt: <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6. 7. When the Angel preached the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel to them that dwell on earth;</hi> the ſubſtance or great part thereof was, <hi>Fear God, and give Glory to him,</hi> &amp;c. and Chap. 15. 3, 4. This ſhall be the ſong of Saints, <hi>Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name, for thou only art holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It's that Virtue unto which happineſs and bleſſedneſs is promiſed, and that muſt needs be a Virtue abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, and is included in true Faith; <hi>Prov. 28. 14. Happy is the man that feareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</hi> This happy fear muſt be alwaies, never off the heart; <hi>Chap. 23. 17. Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day,</hi> that is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, every day; let not the fear of God be out of thine heart at any time; <hi>Pſ. 112. 1. Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and 128. 1, 4. By all which it appears, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who fear God in truth, are under the promiſes of Bleſſedneſs; and therefore it is a choice Virtue.</p>
               <p>2. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew what the<note place="margin">2. What it is to fear God.</note> fear of the Lord is, or what it is to fear God: It is to have an holy, honourable, and reverend eſteem of God, to have the awe and dread of God upon our hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Holy and Reverend is his Name; Pſ.</hi> 33. 8.

Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling: ſerve him with reverence and godly fear.</hi> It is to be feared that Chriſtians have too low and common thoughts of God, which exceedingly unbecometh them, and is a great diſadvantage on the ſpiritual account, as well as diſhonourable unto God. This holy, reverend fear, is a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fear, not a ſlaviſh fear; a ſpouſe-like fear, flowing from, or mixed with love: <hi>Let the Wife ſee that ſhe reverence her Husband,</hi> (or fear her Husband:) The Wives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of, or fear toward her Husband, is not, or ſhould not be ſlaviſh, but in love, and conſcience of God's Ordinance: ſo it behoves every true Chriſtian to reverence, honour, and fear the Lord; and that with this filial ſpouſe-like fear, to love God, and fear before him.</p>

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:40486:174"/> King above all Gods,</hi> and above all men. <hi>Pſal. 89. 6, 7. For who in the Heavens can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Lord? Who among the ſons of the Mighty can be likened unto the Lord? God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of the Saints, and to be had in reverence of all that are round about him.</hi> Note, that this great fear of God in the Saints, does ariſe from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Greatneſs of God; <hi>Who can be compared to the Lord, who may be likened to our God,</hi> in Heaven or Earth? Therefore is he <hi>greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. Pſ. 147. 5. <hi>Great is our Lord, and of great Power, his underſtanding is infinite;</hi> and 95. 3. <hi>For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all Gods.</hi> And, as an effect of this, or a reſultancy drawn from this meditation of his Greatneſs, above all, <hi>ver. 6. O come, let us worſhip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker:</hi> that is, ſeeing he is ſuch a great one above all, even our Maker; let us worſhip and bow down, and kneel before him, <hi>i. e.</hi> Let us worſhip him in all humility, and holy reverence; <hi>Let us have Grace to ſerve our God with reverence and godly fear.</hi> Exod. 15. 11. <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the Gods? who is like unto thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders.</hi> And this reſult the Prophet draws from this meditation; <hi>Jer. 10. 6, 7. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there is none like unto thee, O Lord, and thy Name is great in might, who would not fear thee, O King of Nations; for to thee doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain.</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:40486:175"/> That is, to be great above all, and to be feared above all: this is the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that will tend to ſeaſon our ſouls with this bleſſed Virtue, the greatneſs, the gloriouſneſs of God to live upon our hearts.</p>

God to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this part of his Name and Glory, unites Juſtice and Mercy in the proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Name, to the end that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may love him, and fear before him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 5, 6, 7.

               <p>2. Chriſtians are fleſh as well as ſpirit, and liable to temptation and miſcarriage, woful experience teacheth us this; and God, as a Father, does not only keep his children in awe, with the knowledg of their relation, that ſo love may prevail; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40486:176"/> with the rod, and threats, and danger too, of diſpoſſeſſing of the inheritance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion on that account; and counts it well, if all tend to effect the work: thus dealeth the Lord with his people, elſe what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe various ſayings in his Word? <hi>Pſ. 89. 30, 31, 32. If his children forſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgments; if they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments, then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 7, to 11. And thoſe Judgments executed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly on the people of God for ſin, left on Record for our learning, to the end we might fear to ſin againſt him, leſt we meet with like Judgments: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1. to 11. and <hi>Chap. 11. 30. For this cauſe many are weak and ſick among you, and many ſleep,</hi> &amp;c. All which clearly proveth that God doth afflict his people for ſin; and he hath recorded it, that his people might fear to ſin againſt him. Yea, and further, he keeps his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in awe with threats of diſpoſſeſſing them of the inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. and 4. 1. 11. and 3. 12. 14. 2 <hi>Tit. 2. 12, 13, 14. Rev.</hi> 2 and 3 <hi>Chapters;</hi> all which confirms this truth, that God threatens for ſin, and executes for ſin; and warns to watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the Crown be not loſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 11. Though it's true, that fear flowing from love, is the moſt Evangelical and ſon-like fear: yet a mixture, a fear of God in his whole Name, his Greatneſs, Holineſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40486:177"/> Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, &amp;c. is the moſt ſolid, ſafe, preſerving fear; the ſoul being ballanced with all the means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of God preſcribed to carry on this bleſſed Divine Virtue, is ſutable and uſeful for the accompliſhment thereof. Do not Parents account it well, if all lawful means effect the end; that is, to keep their children in awe and ſubjection; threats and ſtripes as well as love? And doth not God deal with his children accordingly? And doth not Chriſtians that will not ſtand in awe of his Judgments, wonderfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him, that will fear him but in one part of his Name? A dangerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be ſhamed, and avoided of all who deſire to fear God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 5. and 4. 2.</p>

The truth of God in all his Names, and faithfulneſs in all his Word, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Promiſes, and threats againſt ſin and ſinners, will tend to work and increaſe this Grace, <hi>Iſa. 66. 2. But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my Word.</hi> In the Word of God, is declared the whole trembling Name of God in all the parts thereof; and the meditation thereon will cauſe gracious ſouls to fear before him. <hi>Pſal. 119. 161. My heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi> The thoughts of the Authority, Purity, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40486:177"/> and truth of the Word, will beget and increaſe awful and reverend thoughts of God.</p>

Its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</note> of this Virtue: We may ſay of this Virtue as the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Godlineſs, that <hi>it's profitable to all things:</hi> it's the ſumm of Godlineſs, and is uſeful to ballance the ſoul at all times, and in all places and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and to have its exerciſe and uſe in all Virtues: it's the ſoul-ſeaſoning, and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballancing Grace; it's the beginning, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and end of Wiſdom. But to ſpeak more particularly and diſtinctly of this Divine Virtue, in the uſe thereof;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's a ſin-deſtroying Virtue; where the fear of God is, there ſin muſt out: it is is impoſſible for the fear of God, and the love of ſin, to dwell together in the ſoul: <hi>Pſal. 4. 4. Stand in awe, and ſin not;</hi> where the awe of God is, there will be a fear to ſin againſt him: <hi>Gen. 39. 9. Joſeph</hi> ſaid, <hi>How then ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God.</hi> Fear of God occaſions fear of ſinning againſt him; this was it kept <hi>Nehemiah</hi> from oppreſſing the people like the former Governors, <hi>Neh. 5. 15. But ſo did not I, becauſe of the fear of God, Pſ.</hi> 19. 9. The fear of the Lord is clear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it's a purging, cleanſing Virtue; it cleanſeth the ſoul from the love, power, and practiſe of ſin; <hi>Prov. 16. 6. By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil;</hi> and 8. 13. <hi>The fear of the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40486:178"/> Lord is to hate evil, pride and arrogancy, and the evil way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 11, 12, 13. Where the love and fear of God is, there the love of ſin can have no place; and the true cauſe of reigning abominations in any is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fear of God is wanting there: <hi>Pſ. 36. 1. The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes.</hi> O therefore conſider this, you that can ſin without fear; it argues you to be without the fear of God, and to be graceleſs perſons; <hi>Rom. 3. 18. There is no fear of God before their eyes.</hi> And this I fear to be the caſe of many, not only of the World, but of thoſe who pretend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be called out of the World: <hi>Job feared God, and eſchewed evil,</hi> Chap. 1. 1. Fear God and ſin if you dare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fear of God, as it is a ſin-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Virtue, ſo it is a God-obeying Virtue: where the fear of God is in truth, there is conſcience and care to obey the Lord, to keep his Commandments: <hi>Eccl. 12, 13. Fear God, and keep his Commandments;</hi> that is, keep his Commandments as your duty: and where this fear of God is, you will keep his Commandments as your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the fear of God, and obedience to him, alwaies dwells together: <hi>Pſ. 5. 7. As for me, I will come into thine houſe in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy Mercies, and in thy fear will I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip toward thine Holy Temple.</hi> Where ſenſe of Mercy, and power of Love, and the fear
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40486:178"/> of God meet together in one ſoul, there will be ſincere obedience, and worſhipping of God; there will be <hi>ſerving God with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and godly fear:</hi> Pſ. 2. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, rejoyce with trembling.</hi> You that have no care nor conſcience of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord, of ſerving and worſhipping the Lord according to his appointments, and living to him according to his will, have juſt grounds to ſuſpect that you are without the love and fear of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The fear of God is a ſoul-ſanctifying Virtue; where the love and fear of God is, the deſire of that ſoul is to be more like God, and like Chriſt; it doth not only out with ſin, but it increaſeth Virtue: it is as truly deſirous of increaſe in Virtue, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt, as it is to be rid of ſin: outing of ſin is one part of Holineſs, and inning of Virtue is the other; and it's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by the fear of God: <hi>Pſ. 34. 11, 12, 13. Come ye children, hearken to me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all in this, <hi>Depart from evil, and do good, ſeek peace, and purſue it.</hi> This is the way to perfect Holineſs, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> The fear of God is a ſoul-ſanctifying Virtue: would you grow in Holineſs and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Jeſus Chriſt (which I dare ſay is the deſire of all gracious ſouls) both in the inward and outward man, then ſee that you grow in this Virtue.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:40486:179"/>4. The fear of God is a ſoul-conſolating Virtue; it affords very much ground of conſolation to the ſoul where it is; for where this is in truth, there are all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Virtues of the Goſpel to which the promiſes are made, as Faith, Love, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Meekneſs, Patience, Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Divine ſaving Virtues of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant goes not alone, they are much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the truth of the Goſpel, that tell ſouls, that one Grace or Virtue of Chriſt in them, is enough to demonſtrate them to be in a ſaved condition; whereas the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-ſaving Graces or Virtues to which Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is promiſed, goes not alone: he that ſuppoſeth he hath one alone, muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe impoſſibilities; either he hath more; or none at all; <hi>For from his fulneſs we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and Grace for Grace;</hi> that is, of every Divine Virtue of Chriſt, the Believer hath ſomething thereof within him; and where the fear of the Lord is, there is the truth of all Divine Grace; it's laid at bottom of all, as that from whence it flows: <hi>Acts 10. 34, 35. In every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs, ſhall be accepted.</hi> Fear God, and the work will be done, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of comfort to ſouls poſſeſſed with this Virtue: <hi>Prov. 14. 26, 27. The fear of the Lord is ſtrong confidence,</hi> &amp;c. That is, it is a ground of confidence, of intereſt in God, which affords ſtrong conſolation; <hi>Prov. 19. 23. The fear of the Lord tendeth to life, and he
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40486:179"/> that hath it, ſhall abide ſatisfied, he ſhall not be viſited with evil.</hi> It's ſuch a Virtue, ſo much tending to life, that affords ſatisfaction to the ſoul that hath it, that he is in the way of life. Hence the Lord ſaith, (ſpeaking of ſuch a perſon,) <hi>Iſa. 33. 6. The fear of the Lord is his treaſure;</hi> a treaſure of Grace is in it here, and a treaſure of Glory ſhall attend it hereafter; thus ſhall the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fear of God is a ſoul-preſerving<note place="margin">5. It is a ſoul-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace.</note> Grace, a ſoul-ſeaſoning and preſerving Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; it tends to preſerve thoſe in whom it is, to the Kingdom of Glory promiſed: it not only preſerves and keeps the ſoul from ſin, and keeps it cloſe to duty; but it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſoul from defilements in evil times, and daies of temptation: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 15, 16. When they called <hi>the proud, happy; and they that tempted God were delivered; and they that wrought wickedneſs were ſet up: then they that feared God, ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened, and heard it,</hi> &amp;c. That is, he approved it, and owned them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred them in mercy in the day of need. The fear of the Lord will preſerve ſouls pure to God in profane and ſinning times, and in perſecuting times, and in times of temptation: in a word, it will preſerve thoſe in whom it is, through all difficulties and temptations; it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from the ſinful fear of man: <hi>Prov. 29. 25. The fear of man bringeth a ſnare;</hi> Iſa. 51.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40486:180"/> 7, 12, 13. But the fear of God delivereth from this ſnare, it keepeth from <hi>a wicked departing from God; Jer. 32. 40. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> O therefore all ye that fear God, ſeek, that ye may increaſe therein more and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more; it will tend to the increaſe of every Virtue, and decreaſe of ſin; and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you in Faith, Love and Holineſs unto the <hi>day of Redemption.</hi> I conclude this with, <hi>Pſal. 34, 9. O fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him.</hi>

                     <hi>2. How it hath been delivered, 1. To</hi> Adam</note> ſeveral times, and in ſeveral waies and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods delivered; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. The firſt was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtate of Innocency; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. Who by nature was the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal (or root) of all mankind; though it be not in them called Law, yet it was a Law Covenant of Command, with the penalty on the breach thereof. <hi>Of the tree of the Knowledg of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat; for in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> or, in dying, thou ſhalt die. Which Law he tranſgreſſed, and brought in death on himſelf, and all mankind.</p>
               <p>2. After this fall of man, God had his Law in the World condemning ſin, till the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (though not ſo clear and plain) elſe there had been no ſin; for <hi>Where no Law is, there is no tranſgreſſion:</hi>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:40486:182"/> and yet <hi>before the Law, or untill the Law</hi> (given by <hi>Moſes) ſin was in the World:</hi> yet not ſo clear a Law; <hi>For the Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, that ſin might appear to be out of meaſure ſinful.</hi> It was ſinful before, but it did not appear to be ſo ſinful before, as it did after by the Law: they that ſinned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, did not ſin <hi>after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adam'<hi>s tranſgreſſion,</hi> Rom. 5. 14. That is againſt a plain Precept with a threat, as thoſe ſince the Law, who received it, and lived under it as their Law Covenant, and voluntarily brake it, and in that reſpect did ſin after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; though it's true, in ſome reſpects none can ſin after the ſimilitude of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. And that firſt, as he, in a ſtate of innocency, and yet ſinned. 2. As a publick perſon, and ſo let in ſin and death upon all; ſo none but himſelf perſonally could ſin; yet ſin was in the World till the Law, which argueth that there muſt be ſome Law.</p>
               <p>So then the queſtion is, what that Law <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> was? and how it was given and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the opinion of ſome, that it <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> was the Law of Nature written in the hearts of all men, which is the Moral Law, or ſubſtance of the Law given by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, though I ſhall not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this poſition, yet I think it hath need to be inquired into, and to be conſidered with other concurring circumſtances,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40486:183"/> without which it will not hold true; for,</p>
               <p>1. There is no ſuch thing as a Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the hearts of men by nature, to teach them that God is, and is to be worſhipped, and to convince of ſin againſt him, diſtinct from all means without him. And this will appear, if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all Nations in the World know, and worſhip according to the traditions and cuſtoms received, and judg that to be ſin, which by cuſtom and account is ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be: and hence it is, that the World generally, in many things, call good evil, and evil good, and make conſcience of ſo doing, having no Law written in their hearts, that convinces them thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This appears from the Word of Truth, <hi>Rom. 1. 20. For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſtates the way and means of knowing God, where neither Law nor Goſpel is, that is, not ſingly by any Law in the heart, but by the Works and Law of Creation, that preacheth forth God to all Nations, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true; but this Scripture is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <label type="milestone">

                  </label>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:40486:183"/> much miſ-underſtood; for it's evident the Apoſtle intends not the common and unbelieving Gentiles, of them he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the firſt Chapter; but here he ſpeaks of believing Gentiles, thereby to reprove the Jews, who boaſted of the Law, and thence oppoſed the Goſpel, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles that obeyed the Goſpel; (and is the ſame in ſubſtance as that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 31, 32.) and did not walk under the Law as a miniſtration, as the Jews did; and the Apoſtle to ſtop the Jews oppoſite boaſting, endeavors to convince them, that the Gentiles who believed, though they had not the Law, neither were circumciſed, yet being circumciſed in their hearts to God, they were ſafe, and ſhould judg them that boſted ſo much of the Law. That this is the true ſenſe and meaning of that Scripture, is evident; 1. From the occaſion of the words; It's ſuch a doing of, or living to the Law, as is attended with <hi>Glory, Honour, Immortality,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Honour, Glory, and Peace,</hi> ver, 7. 10. And it's the ſame doing intended throughout the Diſcourſe. 2. It's ſuch a doing of the Law as will juſtifie before God, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 3. It's ſuch a doing of the Law as may ſtand with a good conſcience in the day of need; that is, in the day of Judgment, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. 4. It is ſuch a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as flows from an heart ſpiritually cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed to God, and ſhall have <hi>praiſe of him, ver.</hi> 28, 29. It's the ſame Gentiles he
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40486:184"/> was ſpeaking of before, and is the reſult drawn up from the former promiſes; ſo that by the Law written in the heart, we muſt underſtand the Law of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, inclining to believe and obey the Goſpel; or that the Apoſtle held forth another way of Salvation than by Jeſus Chriſt, and the new Covenant, which we may in no caſe imagine.</p>
               <p>I ſhall return to ſhew the waies of God in making known himſelf to men ſince the fall. And, 1. I grant that there is a capacity left in man by nature, in the uſe of means, in ſome meaſure to know God, and to know many things to be ſinful, but not without the concurrency of the uſe of means. I deny not what God might work miraculouſly, he could make the Aſſe to ſpeak, to convince the madneſs of <hi>Balaam,</hi> but his ordinary way hath been in the uſe of means. It is with the ſoul of man, as it is with the body; the eye is called the light of the body, not that there is any light in the eye more than in any other part of the body, but a capacity of ſeeing, or a ſeeing faculty; when the light ſhineth, the eye ſeeth no more than the hand, if there be no light without: So it is in the ſouls of men, there is the eyes of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but it muſt have ſomething propounded from without, before it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, or apprehends: if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to keep men from all means of light,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40486:184"/> either by ſeeing or hearing, the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which is the eye of the ſoul) would remain dark, as the eye of the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light.</p>
               <p>Now the Law or Will of God might very probably, 1. Deſcend ſomething by tradition from <hi>Adam,</hi> who had converſe with God, not only before, but after the fall; and could not but retain much of the knowledg of God, and ſo commend it to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>2. The diſcoveries of the Will of God in the matters of Worſhip, and the manner thereof in offering of ſacrifices, which could not (ordinarily) come by nature, but by ſome way of inſtitution. Some diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his Will by Divine Inſpiration, in way of Prophecy, as is plain; <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 14. <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from</hi> Adam <hi>prophecied,</hi> &amp;c. And God ſpake ſometimes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Fathers, and thoſe diſcoveries of God were propagated to Poſterity, though much corrupted: and doubtleſs there is at this day much of tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome of the Heathens about circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ceremonies corruptly practiſed by tradition, as offering ſacrifice, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, offering their firſt-born to God, and owning only one God, their Prieſts and Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth and moſt common way of God's teaching mankind throughout all Ages, (eſpecially where other means hath
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40486:185"/> failed) hath been by his works of Creation, and Preſervation, in which was, and is, a ſufficiency to teach the knowledg of God, as to his being; and from hence that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city left in man, might learn the ſubſtance of the Moral Law, but not without this means; that the Creation was a ſufficient means to teach the knowledg of God; <hi>i. e.</hi> That there was a God infinite in his being, and glorious, the former of all things; and that this was God's way of teaching, the Apoſtle plainly aſſerts; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. And the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>There was, and is a capacity in man, (by this means and help;) 1. To conclude that there is a God, the Creator and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of all; that he muſt be infinite in Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs. And, 2. From reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conclude, that there is but one God, not a plurality in Eſſence, Will, and Work; but that there muſt be unity in ſo great and glorious a Work. And then; 3. That it's a duty to be ſubject to this Creator, and that he muſt be honoured and worſhipped according to his own will, as far as underſtood: that this Inviſible, Powerful, Wiſe God, that made all things, muſt needs be Holy, as Great, and Wiſe; and his Will muſt be the Law to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that the tranſgreſſion thereof muſt needs be ſinful: and from hence muſt neceſſarily underſtand what was for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40486:185"/> good and ſociety of mankind, being capacitated with reaſon, exerciſed thus in in the uſe of means, might and did attain much; and I dare not but to think, that in this means God hath from the beginning wrought many ſouls ſavingly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>And thus it appears that there was a Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> a means to know God, (and in ſome meaſure to know duty, and to know ſin) before the Law was given; and the ſame means do the World yet injoy, where the Goſpel is not preached.</p>
               <p>2. God made known himſelf, and Will, to his Servants, both before and after the Flood, to <hi>Noah;</hi> and eſpecially to <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he called out from the reſt of the World, to whom he gave great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, with whom he made the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and gave him circumciſion, in which was included the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. And after he appeared to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and moſt of all to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to and by whom he gave the Law and old Covenant to his people, in which was the Covenant of Life and Peace darkly held forth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. And in which was contained the duties of his people, till the anointed one promiſed was come; the great Lord and Law-giver of this new Covenant of Life, unto whom we are to ſubmit our ſelves in all things.</p>
               <p>3. That it was, and is neceſſary for men
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40486:186"/> to belive and obey God according to the means and miniſtration throughout all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; and the ſin of thoſe who lived not up to the means and light of the time and miniſtration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As given before the Law, and where Law nor Goſpel never came; if there be any place or people in the World where its ſound hath not been heard, their duty was, and is, to know, believe, and ſerve God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the means afforded, and they ſhall be thereby accordingly judged, <hi>Rom. 2. 12, 16.

               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that live under the Goſpel, it's their duty to believe and obey God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of the Goſpel, and new Covenant, as it's adminiſtred and given forth by Jeſus Chriſt the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2.

                  <note place="margin">1.

               <p>1. That the Law, as a miniſtration in<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Yet, 1. As given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>it is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
                  </note> the hand of, or as given by <hi>Moſes</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is done away and aboliſhed, as it required righteouſneſs unto Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4, 5. Though of it ſelf it never juſtified any, but was indeed the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of condemnation:</hi> for had it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a righteouſneſs to Juſtification, it could not have been the miniſtration of condemnation; and on both theſe accounts it's done away to Believers, and aboliſhed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, to 11. And on this account (as adminiſtred from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>) it's done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as a rule; for as it was a rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſo it became the miniſtration of condemnation, and ſo Believers are <hi>dead to it by the body of Chriſt,</hi> being eſpouſed to him, as the Wife is free from the Law of her Husband, being dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4, 6.</p>
               <p>Yet, 2. Believers are not without the<note place="margin">2. Believers are not without the Law.</note> Law, but it is to them the rule of Holineſs,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40486:187"/> as given by their Lord and Law-giver; and ſo is no miniſtration of condemnation to Believers, being in the hand of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, he having fulfilled the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof for us in his own perſon, actively in living up perfectly to it, and the penal part thereof for us in his ſufferings; but that it is to Believers (as his Law, and given by him) a rule of Holineſs, (is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all juſt ground of queſtion) but not of righteouſneſs unto Juſtification, but of Converſation, righteouſneſs unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being alone, by, and for the ſuffering ſake of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Reaſons why the Law, as in the hand of Chriſt, is a rule of Life to Believers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it's ſo ſtated in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; 1 <hi>Tit. 1. 8, 9, 10, 11.

That is, righteous men are not under the Law, that is, under the rule and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof, as given by <hi>Moſes, Rom.</hi> 6. 14.

If there be any thing elſe that is contrary to ſound Doctrine;</hi> that is, the Law condemns what-ever is contrary to the ſound Doctrine of the Goſpel; as <hi>ver. 11. According to the glorious Goſpel of the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:40486:187"/> Bleſſed God,</hi> &amp;c. That is, the Law of the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns what-ever is contrary to it. The Law is brought forth in the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and is become the rule of the bleſſed God to Believers; and who-ever walks contrary to it, muſt be condemned by our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, who is the Lord of this bleſſed and glorious miniſtration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 9. 10. and 3. 31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid; yea, we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> God forbid that any ſhould have ſuch thoughts; no, it eſtabliſheth the Law; and that, 1. In its Righteouſneſs and Juſtice given in the old miniſtration, that it muſt be fulfilled for us, that we might be (through believing) juſtified from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and ſo that it might be fulfilled in us, and by us, as our Sanctification; <hi>Rom. 8. 4. That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> &amp;c. That is, in us by believing and obeying Chriſt therein: and this the Apoſtle ſtates in plain words, that he was <hi>under the Law to Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law in it ſelf, as given by God, <hi>is Spiritual, Holy, Juſt, and Good,</hi> Rom. 7. 12, 14. And we cannot expect a better rule of life for Sanctification, than a <hi>Spiritual, Holy, Juſt and Good Law;</hi> It's the manner of adminiſtring makes the difference, and not the matter in the ſubſtance thereof, the manner differs. It's given by Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fulfilled the righteouſneſs thereof, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40486:188"/> born the penalty, by which means it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Law, and he hath it in his hand to give it forth as his Royal Law, as an holy rule for his people to ſerve him by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's that Law which in the ſubſtance thereof, requires that we ſhould <hi>love the Lord our God with all our hearts, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as our ſelves,</hi> Mat. 22. 37, 38, 39. And this muſt needs be the Law of the Goſpel, if we will have any Law at all; it's true the Law required it, but the Goſpel effects it, it effects what the Law required, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. The love of Chriſt constrains us,</hi> that is, it maketh us willing to love and obey the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Law in the matter thereof is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, therefore not to be done away in the matter or ſubſtance, but in the manner of adminiſtring, as adminiſtred in the old Teſtament; that called the Moral Law, was the foundation of the Ceremonial and Judicial, they were both drawn out of the Moral; the Moral in the firſt part thereof required the worſhipping of the one true God; the Ceremonial ſhews how this one God would be worſhipped: the ſecond part relates to the duties of men each to other; the Judicial opens thoſe duties, with the penalty of the breach thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating both to God and men.</p>
               <p>And as it is in the hand of Chriſt, it is the ſame ſtill; the Moral Law ſubſtantially is the foundation of all duty, as to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40486:188"/> of the converſation; for the duty of it was never taken away, as it tends to holineſs; and as it is in the hand of Chriſt, it calls for Faith in him, and obedience to him; for the riſe of all duty was from the Law, which had its riſe from the holy God, and ſutable to its being opened, was to be obeyed.</p>
               <p>And the perfection required in the holy and juſt Law of God, will be the perfection of Saints in Glory; perfection in love and holineſs will be the glorious ſtate of Saints; and (indeed) it was the great deſign of God in the Goſpel, by Jeſus Chriſt, to bring up a people to the ſpiritual perfection requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Law, which is begun here by Faith and Holineſs, and ſhall be perfected in Glory.</p>
               <p>So then this being the ſpiritual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule of Holineſs drawn by God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and preſented to men as a character of that perfection he deſigned to bring up his people to by Jeſus Chriſt, it remains in his hand as the foundation of all Law and Spirit working in the heart, for the gradual perfecting of the Saints therein.</p>
               <p>To make this clear, that it is as to the matter thereof the ſame, and muſt be the ſame in the ſubſtance thereof; for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the owning and worſhipping the one true God in Holineſs, which is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel, and will be the eternal duty and work of Saints in Glory. And
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40486:189"/> Jeſus Chriſt the Lord of this Goſpel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and Mediator of the Goſpel-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, gives us rules as to the manner how God will and muſt be worſhipped; and to him are we bound to ſubmit in all his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Inſtitutions, about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and matter of his inſtituted Worſhip, and not turn back to the Moſaical Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but now Chriſt gives rules in the Goſpel, as the Ceremonial Law did under that miniſtration; and if we refuſe Chriſts Inſtitutions, and go back to <hi>Moſes,</hi> we muſt loſe our part and intereſt in Chriſt and the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4. And the Judicial Law we have from Chriſt, to curb ſin and tranſgreſſion, and to keep order in his Kingdom in this imperfect ſtate: that is, the Order, Offices, and Government in his Church, his Houſe, his Kingdom, and both rules of Worſhip and Diſcipline flows ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from the right of the Moral Law, as the Ceremonial and Judicial did, though now as a part of the new Covenant in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That it was the Law given by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Tables of Stone, that Chriſt fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:40486:189"/> in his active and paſſive obedience, for and in behalf of ſinners: and then it was for the ſins committed againſt that Law, the truth hereof appears from Scripture; the Scripture ſpeaks not of any other Law, that was the Law which Chriſt came to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. That was the Covenant and Law, God made with his people, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt Covenant, and as a Covenant and Miniſtration, was to be done away, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33. Whether this Law was given to <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, or written in him, I ſhall not diſpute: It's that in which the Scripture is ſilent: if we ſuppoſe that it was written in him, we muſt likewiſe ſuppoſe it to be much inferior to the writing of the Law in the hearts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the new Covenant; for he fell from his eſtate, and all we in him; but the Law of the new Covenant is ſo written in the heart, as that <hi>they ſhall never depart from him;</hi> it ſhall be their eternal perfection in Glory; and the deſign of God herein is, not to bring us back to <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt eſtate, who in his firſt and beſt eſtate <hi>was of the earth earthly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 47. But to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man, which is <hi>the Lord from Heaven.</hi> Yet I ſhall not queſtion but that the whole Law might be included in that one inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Ordinance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. As it was in that inſtituted Ordinance of Circumciſion given to <hi>Abraham, Gen. 17. 10, &amp;c.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. And in the Goſpel,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40486:190"/> the inſtituted Ordinance of Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the whole Law of the Goſpel, <hi>Mar. 16. 15, 16. Gal.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
               <p>And ſo that inſtituted Ordinance being broken, the Law might be the <hi>flaming Sword in the hand of the Angel, to keep the way of the tree of Life,</hi> that none could enter but by the Mediator; for the Law it was which ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all entrance again to God, but by the Mediator; the Law it was that did curſe for ſin, and was the fiery adminiſtration of death; and this is the Law that Chriſt did bear the curſe thereof for ſinners.</p>
               <p>2. And then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that Chriſt died for the tranſgreſſions that was againſt this Law ever ſince the fall of man, and not ſo properly in a meritorious way; for <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion againſt that inſtituted Ordinance, in eating the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, for which death came in upon him and his poſterity, and we are all under the execution of that ſentence, which was eſpecially the nihilating of the body, with the miſeries attending that ſentence in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, and an uſher (though not the cauſe) to eternal miſery.</p>
               <p>For the eternal ſtate of man is brought in by Jeſus Chriſt, but that ſentence paſt no further than this, <hi>Gen. 3. 19. Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> There is not a word of eternal death in miſery, but the undoing of what God had done, and the eternal eſtate came in by the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40486:190"/> of Jeſus Chriſt; eternal Life and Glory to ſuch as believe and obey the Goſpel, and death and condemnation to unbelievers for their ſin againſt him, and not accepting his Grace, although he came not into the World <hi>until the fulneſs of time determined was come,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. Till then God accepted of ſincerity of Faith and ſervice, according to the time and means both of Jew and Gentile; yet ſtill, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſpect to Jeſus Chriſt; for God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of no man after the fall, but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the promiſed ſeed; and all ſaved ones ſhall know, that their Salvation is by him; and all condemned ones ſhall know that their condemnation is for ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt, elſe how ſhall he be the Judge of all: ſo that it followeth, that the ſins for which Chriſt died, was the ſins committed againſt the righteous Law and Goſpel of God ſince the fall, and not ſo properly for <hi>Adam</hi>'s particular ſin by which he fell, (for that puniſhment paſſeth on all,) unleſs it be, that by his death and reſurrection, he recovers all mankind out of that eſtate into which they fell. And this is a general redemption, by the death and reſurrection of Chriſt the ſentence of death paſt on all men; and Chriſt Jeſus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes that ſentence in behalf of all men, and riſeth again, and ſo conquereth death in behalf of mankind, recovers the Malefactors from the power of death after
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40486:191"/> the execution of the ſentence, and ſo doth no wrong to the Law, nor Juſtice executed in that ſentence. So that it's a truth, that the ſins for which Chriſt ſuffered, was the ſins of mankind ſince the fall. And this doth further appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſin and trangreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> by which death came into the World, is not mentioned in the Scripture to be the cauſe, or any part of the cauſe of Chriſt's ſuffering, unleſs, as was laſt mentioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture frequently expreſſeth the death and ſufferings of Chriſt to be for the ſins of the World, and for our ſins, <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſins after the fall being included; <hi>Joh. 1. 29. Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World;</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3. <hi>How that Jeſus Chriſt died for our ſins according to the Scripture;</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſins,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. With multitudes of Scriptures to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that might be produced. And he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>ſins and tranſgreſſions committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. <hi>i. e.</hi> the firſt after the fall; for mankind had done with that before the fall, except being under its execution:) for all the ſins in the World have been in ſome ſenſe (as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed) againſt that Teſtament and Holy Law, and againſt Jeſus Chriſt, by whom all have ſubſiſted ſince the fall; ſo that we may come to reſult in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:40486:191"/>1. That <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Ordinance, was the cauſe and way by which ſin and death came in upon all men, which ſhould make all men tremble in the thoughts of making light of the inſtituted Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Law by which ſin hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the World, is the holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Will of God declared, according to the times, waies and means by himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; and that men of themſelves, in their own wills, have conſtantly acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Jeſus Chriſt died to ſave men from the condemnation of their own ſins againſt God, ſince the fall; and to recover all men out of that ſtate of death into which they fell by <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Holy Law of God in the hand of Chriſt our Mediator, is the holy rule of life to Believers; and that in which they ſhould grow and increaſe till they come to Glory: to cleave to Jeſus Chriſt in all the Laws of the new Covenant, as adminiſtred and given forth by him; in which is contained the eſſence and ſubſtance of the Law, and that in the higheſt and moſt glorious way of adminiſtring, till we come to Glory.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Of Prayer.</head>
               <p>AS God is, and is to be worſhipped; ſo one great part of the worſhip of God is Prayer, thereby we acknowledge him to be, and our want of ſupply from him and his ability to help us, it is ſuch a part of Goſpel Worſhip which includes all goſpel virtues in it, unto which the promiſe is made, <hi>Rom,</hi> 10. 13. from the Goſpel-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Joel 2. 32. Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi> in ſpeaking diſtinctly to this matter, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, 1. What Prayer is. 2. By whom it is to be performed. 3. That it is a duty of ſpecial concernment to be performed by thoſe concerned in it. 4. The manner how it is to be performed. 5. The priviledges thereof and the incouragements thereunto, and the hinderances and diſcouragements that ſometimes Chriſtians meet with all in this ſervice; and in theſe I ſhall be very brief, yet as plain and as full as brevity will permit.</p>
               <p>1. What Prayer is. 1. More generally,<note place="margin">What Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is.</note> Prayer includes Confeſſion, Contrition, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, Thanksgiving, and may be, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40486:192"/> is performed all in one, and comes under that of Prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 3, to 20. where under Prayer is included much of confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and humble confeſſion of ſpirit, with earneſt petition: and <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſometimes Pſalms, and ſometimes Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, becauſe both was contained in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 20. and good it is for the Saints to be much exerciſed in all theſe parts of prayer, that ſo much ſutes our low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and needs, and the greatneſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of him to whom we pray.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall eſpecially ſpeak to the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary part of Prayer, that being moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and diſtinctly prayer, as that doctrine and rule of prayer preſcribed by our Lord doth manifeſt, which conſiſts eſpecially in Petition; and on this account, prayer is the asking or begging ſomething of God, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt; that either our ſelves or others do want and ſtand in need of, either for body or ſoul, in things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this life or that which is to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. to 11. Prayer is not appointed as a complementing work, but that the ſoul might therein and thereby go to God, in all holy and humble boldneſs, to make known its wants, and beg ſupplies and help in all caſes of need; it is to come with all holy boldneſs <hi>to the throne of Grace,</hi> in the name of Jeſus Chriſt in faith and expectation, in that way to receive from the Father what we truly need.</p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:40486:193"/>
               <p>But more particularly as to the matter of Prayer. 1. It muſt be good and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God, if we fail in this we fail in all, for we have no promiſe of hearing, further then we pray according to his will, 1 <hi>John 5. 14. And this is the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> And this is one ſpecial work of the ſpirit in the hearts of Saints, to help them to pray <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, Ro.</hi> 8. 27. perſons may pray in their own ſpirits, and be very earneſt, and will have no nay for that which God would not have them, and it may be is not good for them, and he may give it them in judgement. I believe that many have experience of this truth at this day, as his people of old, <hi>Pſal. 78. 18. They tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their luſts,</hi> v. 29. 30, 31. <hi>He gave them their hearts deſire, but while the meat was in their mouths the wrath of God came upon them;</hi> they muſt have their luſts fulfilled, and their luſts they had, but in anger and in wrath, with vengeance for their luſting; ſo the ſame people <hi>Iſrael</hi> luſted for a King, and would have no nay, and God gave them their deſire, <hi>Hoſ. 13. 11. I gave thee a King in my anger, and took him away in my wrath.</hi> It greatly behoves Chriſtians to look to the matter what they pray for, that they pray for that which is good, for which they have ſome precept or promiſe, either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40486:193"/> or particularly, and that too accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the terms thereof, either abſolute or conditional, that is, of ſubmiſſion to the will of God relating either to thing or time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is abſolutely promiſed, we may and ought abſolutely to pray for, as Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin, Sanctification of Life, Preſervation in the Faith, Perſeverance in Grace to the end, with profiting under the various diſpenſations of God in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which comes under ſome ſpecial command or promiſe, either general or particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some things we muſt pray for condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, with ſubmiſſion to the will of God, both relating to thing and time, as Health, Peace, deliverance from Affliction, proſperity in the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe theſe are things of worldly and temporary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, and not abſolutely neceſſary to the life of the new Covenant, nor abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely promiſed; Chriſt our Lord is an example to us in this matter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 39, yet we may pray abſolutely in this, ſo far as God hath promiſed, that is, Food and Rayment is promiſed, <hi>all theſe things ſhall be added to you,</hi> but worldly riches is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but Food and Rayment is promiſed, becauſe <hi>your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of theſe things;</hi> you cannot live nor ſubſiſt without them, nor ſerve God in the world without them: That was it
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40486:194"/> which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>that if God would give him Food to eat, and Cloaths to put on, then God ſhould be his God,</hi> becauſe without it he could not live; if God would keep him alive he would live to God; ſo that for Food and Rayment we ought to pray in faith, and to believe the promiſe, <hi>all theſe things ſhall be added,</hi> Mat. 6. 33.</p>
               <p>And as for Deliverance from Afflictions, Chriſtians ought to pray abſolute for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under them, and profiting by them, and deliverance in the Lords time; time not the deliverance, and then you may be abſolute, and that becauſe you have the promiſe, <hi>Pſ. 50. 15. Iſa.</hi> 45. 17.</p>
               <p>2. By whom this duty of Prayer is to be<note place="margin">2. By whom it is to be performed.</note> performed, and that is by believers, though I ſhall not queſtion the common duty of all men in this matter, but none can perform it acceptably, but Believers, Juſtified perſons; God firſt accepts the perſon before the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is accepted, it is <hi>the Prayers of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man that availeth much, Jam.</hi> 5. 16. as for others, ſee what God ſaith, <hi>Pſ. 50. 16, 17.

               </p>

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:40486:195"/> 
                  <hi>Eph. 6. 18. Praying always with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 17. Pray continually,</hi> Col. 4. 2. <hi>Continue in prayer, and watch in the ſame with thanksgiving;</hi> by all which, and many other Exhortations in Holy Scripture it appeareth, that Prayer is the ſpecial duty of the Saints.</p>
               <p>2. It appears from the frequent example of the Lords people throughout all ages, who were frequently exerciſed in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine duty and work, as <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. 23, to 33. <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32. 30, 31, 32, &amp; 33. 13 &amp; 34. 91. <hi>Solomon, 1 King 8. 22. David, Pſ.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 17. 1, 2, &amp;c. &amp; 55. 16, 17. in the New Teſtament, Chriſt himſelf was very often exerciſed in this work, <hi>Mat. 14. 23. Luke</hi> 6. 12. and <hi>Paul, Phil. 1. 9. Col. 1. 9. 1 Theſ.</hi> 3. 10. The Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 24. to 31. and the whole Church, Chap. 2. 42. with multitudes of like examples both in old and new Teſtament; all which confirms the truth, that it is the great duty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the Saints, according to the will of God, to be frequently exerciſed therein.</p>
               <p>3. It appears to be a very acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Lord when rightly performed, from the acceptance thereof which God hath manifeſted, and the returns that he hath made to the prayers of his people throughout all ages, wherein he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf to be well pleaſed with the faithful prayers of his people, in his
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40486:195"/> hearing and anſwering of their prayers; ſee his anſwer to <hi>Abraham</hi> in his requeſts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 21, to 33. to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32. 33, 34. &amp; 33. 14. 17. to <hi>Jehoſhaphat, 2 Chron.</hi> 20. 6, 15, 16, 17. to <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18. 6, 7, 8. &amp; 118. 5. <hi>I called upon the Lord in diſtreſs, he anſwered me and ſet me in a large place.</hi> In a word, the Lord never commanded his people <hi>to ſeek his face in vain,</hi> Iſa. 45. 19. <hi>I ſaid not to the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek ye me in vain;</hi> and of this his people hath had experience, and muſt ſay (if they ſpeak true of him) as <hi>Moſes, Deut. 4. 7. What Nation is there ſo great who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God in all that we call upon him for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may add 4. that an unpraying people are noted in Scripture to be a Graceleſs and Godleſs people; <hi>The workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 14. 4. <hi>Are a people that call not upon God;</hi> and Pſal. 10. 4. <hi>The wicked in the pride of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance will not ſeek after God; God is not in all his thoughts;</hi> wicked men, if they pray, it is but in form, and for fear, or cuſtome and tradition, and not in faith and love with conſtancy, as gracious perſons doth, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10. ſpeaking of the Hypocrite, <hi>will he always call upon God?</hi> No, he will not, it is of cuſtome, or for fear, or to be ſeen of men, if he doth it at all; and as wicked men are a prayerleſs people, ſo it is a note of a Godly man to be a praying man. No ſooner was <hi>Saul</hi> converted, <hi>but behold he prayeth, Acts</hi> 9. 11. which was given as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40486:196"/> to <hi>Annanias</hi> that he was a converted man, and the Prophet deprecates againſt an unpraying people. <hi>Jer. 10. 25. Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not upon thy name. Pſal.</hi> 79. 6. by all which it appeareth, that prayer is the ſpecial duty of the people of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The fourth particular relates to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">4.

In the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our prayers when we are kept to, and helpt in the right matter of prayer; the matter you have heard, it muſt be good, and according to the will of God, when we are rightly lead in this matter, it is by the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 8. 26, 27. We know not what we pray for as we ought,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, and make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us according to the will of God.</hi> There is much in this, to have our hearts lead in the will of God in our praying. When perſons run out in their own ſpirits and in their own wills, and it may be beſides the matter of prayer, there is nothing of the ſpirit of Chriſt therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We then pray with the Spirit, when our own ſpirits are ſet at work in the duty; prayer by the ſpirit is not lip labour only, but heart work, when we (as we ought in all other ſervices) in prayer, ſerve God with our Spirits, with our whole Heart, <hi>Rom. 1. 9. God is my witneſs whom I ſerve with my ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Son,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 119. 10. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee, O let me not wander from thy Commandments;</hi> then have we the ſpirit of Chriſt in Prayer, when our whole heart is in the work, <hi>My Son give me thy heart;</hi> the Spirit works the heart to God according to his word, and in this note, that (ordinarily) when the ſpirit worketh in our hearts to the work, it works the heart beyond the words; and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:40486:197"/> here lyeth the difference between Praying in the Spirit and without the Spirit; he that prayeth in the ſpirit, his ſpirit thereby out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runs his words, he is more in heart then in word, the ſpirit worketh in us with <hi>Groanings that cannot be uttered;</hi> that is, heart groanings and deſirings beyond the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but the other his tongue out runs his heart, he is far better at lip labour, then at heart work in Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then we pray by the Spirit, and in a right manner, when we pray in Faith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leving, that is the right ſpirit of prayer; then pray we by the ſpirit, and in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for the ſpirit of Chriſt is the Spirit of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 13.

The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much;</hi> and its the work of the ſpirit to fill us with true zeal and fervency in prayer, when the ſoul will have no nay, like <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtling with God, <hi>Gen. 32. 26. I will not let thee go except you bleſs me.</hi> Hoſ. 12. 4. <hi>He had power with the Angel and prevailed, he wept and made ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> And this fervency conſiſteth not ſo much in multitudes of expreſſions, or loudneſs of voice, but in pouring out our ſouls to the Lord, and in ſtrength of faith to prevail with him, <hi>Pſ. 42. 4. When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe things, I pour out my ſoul in me,</hi> &amp; 25. 1. <hi>I lift my ſoul to thee,</hi> &amp; 143. 8.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:40486:201"/> everlaſting Covenant; ſo that we are to perform this and every ſervice in his Name, that is, in his authority, by virtue of his commiſſion and command, <hi>Matt. 7. 7. 8. John</hi> 16. 26.</p>
               <p>2. To Pray in the Name of Chriſt, is to offer up our Prayers to the Father, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons intereſſed in Chriſt by Faith, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word, believing and expecting acceptance with the Father for the ſake of Chriſt, and not for any worth in our ſelves; Jeſus Chriſt, Son to the King of Glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our only way of acceptance, both of our perſons and ſervices: therefore we muſt by Faith in all our addreſſes to the Throne of Grace, have reſpect to Jeſus, as our way, and as upon the Throne for us, to plead our cauſe, and to preſent the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and ſervices of his people in himſelf to the Father; he is our friend in the Court of Heaven, and to pray the Father in his Name, is to pray the Father for his ſake to accept us, and grant our requeſts; becauſe by the Law of the new Covenant we belong to him, and are the children of God by Faith in him. And the reaſon why we muſt offer up all in the Name of Chriſt is, becauſe we are imperfect, and our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice imperfect, and can have no acceptance but in him, and for his ſake, who is perfect, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>11. As an effect of this acceptation in<note place="margin">11. To pray boldly.</note> our dear Lord, and for his ſake, a right
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:40486:201"/> Goſpel way of praying is, to pray boldly; an holy, humble boldneſs becometh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and God is well pleaſed therewith: He would have them come with <hi>boldneſs to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4. 16. He having opened ſuch <hi>a new and living way,</hi> ſo full of Grace, he would have his children to know it, and improve it with all holy and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble boldneſs, and confidence, believing his readineſs and willingneſs to hear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the prayers of his people: God would have his people to exerciſe ſo much Faith in the way of the Goſpel, that new and living way, as to command of him what he hath promiſed to give, becauſe he hath of his own Grace bound himſelf to it by his new Covenant Law promiſe, and he takes it as Glory to his Name, for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to believe that he will not, cannot with-hold what he hath promiſed: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Believers ought to come to God with holy boldneſs, and humble claiming their right, by Grace, in the bleſſings, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed things promiſed in the new Covenant, as the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 24. to 31.</p>
               <p>12. To pray in a right manner, is to<note place="margin">12. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</note> pray conſtantly, and not to faint and give over: if you wax weary, either through a carnal careleſneſs and ſluggiſhneſs, or fainting for fear of not being anſwered, it's the way to loſe all; and as a neceſſary ingredient to conſtancy, and perſevering herein, you muſt add patience; <hi>Pſ. 40. 1. I
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:40486:202"/> waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and heard my crie:</hi> that is, it was long before I had an anſwer; but I waited long, and patiently, and had my deſire in the end. Chriſt put forth that Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1.—to this very end, <hi>That men ought alwaies to pray, and not to faint;</hi> to aſſure us, that if we wax not weary, God will hear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the end; <hi>Rom. 12. 12.

The Prophet fixes on the morning, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 5. 3. and 55. 17. <hi>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and crie aloud, and he ſhall hear my voice.</hi> O that Chriſtians would lay this to heart, and not bethink time to ſpend in this holy and heavenly ſervice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God; but according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 17. To pray without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> that is, without being weary, or giving over, or neglecting ſo holy, acceptable, and needful a ſervice: it is a note of an hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, that <hi>does not alwaies call upon God,</hi> Job 27. 10. but by fits and ſtarts, when he hath a mind to it; or for fear, in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

With multitudes of others that I might mention in holy Scripture, that have prevailed with God in this way, and indeed it is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of all the Saints; God will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by them, when they pray accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will revealed in his Word; <hi>Iſa. 45. 11.

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:40486:203"/> lives in the will of God, may ſay truly, that he hath his will granted at all times.</p>
               <p>4. Priviledg is free converſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion<note place="margin">4.

Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is to the Saints a ſon-like and friendly converſing with God, who is a conſuming fire to his enemies, but a Father and a friend in Jeſus Chriſt to his children, who have this priviledge to come boldly to him, to have acceſs with acceptance at his Throne of Grace, and to commune with him about the great things of his will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his Glory, and their own eternal welfare, according to the Goſpel of his Grace in Jeſus Chriſt: priviledges they are, unto which all carnal hearts (though wiſe in the World's wiſdom) are ſtrangers too, their ſouls come not in ſight of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. O that all ſincere hearted Chriſtians did more ſtudy, prize, and improve this Mercy.</p>
               <p>Though theſe priviledges are all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to this duty, and who, or what Chriſtian ſoul, intereſted in ſuch
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:40486:204"/> Grace and favour, can neglect a duty atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſuch ſoul-advantages; it's the way to maintain friendſhip with God: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are negligent in this duty, grow carnal, and eſtranged from God, and liable to reproof and judgment: it was the ſin that <hi>Job</hi>'s friends ſuppoſed him to be guilty of, as the cauſe of his affliction; <hi>Job 15. 4. Yea, thou caſteſt off fear, and restraineſt Prayer before God.</hi> But I add to theſe, as a further encouragement.</p>
               <p>5. The great and precious promiſes of<note place="margin">5.

Matt. 7. 7. Joh. 15. 7. Jam. 1. 5. If any man want wiſdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him:</hi> but the promiſe of Salvation is made unto it, being performed according to the rules preſcribed, which includes all the virtues of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, unto which the promiſes are made; <hi>Joel 2. 32.

New Covenant ſpirited praying people are under the promiſe of Salvation; therefore let all new Covenant ſpirited people be encouraged to this work
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:40486:204"/> and duty, as one of the moſt noble, Son-like parts of Chriſtians obedience, full of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantage to the ſoul, as well as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory to God.</p>
               <p>6. And laſtly, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething<note place="margin">6. Laſtly of the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Prayer. 1. That it is not a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> to ſome of the hinderances and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements that Chriſtians meet with all ſometimes in the performance of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes with ſome perſons, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Principle, that Prayer to God is no duty, nor ought not ſo to be performed, but only as a priviledge or liberty, or at moſt if a duty, yet not to be performed by Chriſtians, without ſome more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary movings thereunto by the Spirit of Chriſt; and that without this it is but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and fleſhly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from hence they neglect this duty.</p>
               <p>In anſwer hereunto, and to help the ſoul out of this miſtake; conſider and ponder well, 1. That Prayer is a duty, and is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo ſtated in the Scripture (as hath been before proved) and ought ſo to be practiſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 8, 9, 10. and this noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on runs contrary to and thwart the law of the New Covenant, and ſo cannot be of God, and whence then it is you may eaſily judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its a Notion never mentioned by Chriſt or his Apoſtles in the Scriptures, who were frequently exerciſed in this work according to time, place, and opportunity,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:40486:205"/> therefore an unſcriptural and new founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The event diſcovers it whence it is, intending to make ſuch perſons to become Prayerleſs, and ſo by deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ees (if grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not) graceleſs perſons, woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath taught us the truth of this; its a temptation that gracious perſons have met withall, and have ſuffered much of loſs thereby, on the ſpiritual account, it being the Devils deſign under any pretence, to work off ſouls from this duty. Yet fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it concerns Chriſtians to perform it as a duty, and in ſpirit too, the duty deſtroys not, nor hinders ſpiritual ſervice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it cannot be ſpiritual where it is not performed to God in conſcience as duty; prayer with and in the ſpirit is a duty, <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always in the holy ſpirit, and pray without ceaſing,</hi> &amp;c. and where it is in conſcience to God performed by believers, the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is never wanting to doe his office, if we are faithful to our duty; therefore be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to be faithful in your duty, and be ſure you ſhall not want the Spirit of Chriſt to aſſiſt you in this or any other ſervice of his.</p>
               <p>2. Others are diſcouraged in this duty<note place="margin">The ſenſe of ſin.</note> from the ſenſe of their ſinfulneſs, their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt natures.

If thou haſt the Spirit of Prayer (as that thou haſt in ſome meaſure, if thou be a Chriſtian in truth, for if <hi>any man have not the ſpirit of Christ he is none of his</hi>) Then be not diſcouraged though thou haſt but little of the gift of utterance, men may have the gift without the ſpirit, although where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſpirit and gift goes together, it is of choice uſe for the Church; yet be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, for <hi>God accepts his children accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what they have, and not according to what they have not;</hi> therefore if thou canſt make known thy wants and weakneſſes, though thy language be not eloquent, yet groan it, and cry it out before the Lord <hi>who knoweth the meaning of the Spirit;</hi> for where the ſpirit of Chriſt is, it will help <hi>to cry, Abba Father,</hi> and know that as a Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth more in the ſtammering and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken language of his little Child, then in the moſt compoſed ſpeech of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Orator; yea, and it may be more then in the moſt accute language of his own grown Children; ſo doth God, the Father of all Believers, delight in the Prayers of his own poor weak Children, coming from ſincere hearts <hi>and faith unfeigned,</hi> more then in the moſt excellent language of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite or Stranger, and as much as in the well ordered Prayers of his own more
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:40486:207"/> grown and gifted children; therefore be not diſcouraged in this matter, and if thy Father ſee it beſt in thy faithful exerciſe of what thou haſt, he will give you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p>3. It may be thy Father ſeeth that the Spirit of Prayer without much of gift is beſt for thee, to keep thee humble and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it may be thou wouldſt be proud and ruine thy ſelf if thou hadſt ſuch gifts as ſome others have, but he knows what is beſt, and gives ſutable to our abilities, though its true, that abilities to a right uſe of gifts, are of him likewiſe.</p>
               <p>4. We are to know, that God gives his gifts variouſly and differingly as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and that for the uſe and edification of the Church, for that indeed is the great end and uſe of gifts, and he never intended to give to all his children gifts for publick ſervice in the Church; <hi>are all Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. no, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>For there are ways for uſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtians gifts, though not in a

               <p>1.

                     </gap>rnfully before him,</hi> Mal. 3. 14. But it often comes to paſs, that God doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Prayers of his people from ſeveral juſt grounds which I ſhall endeavour to ſhew as followeth.</p>
               <p>1. It may be thou Prayeſt for that which<note place="margin">Grounds of Gods not anſwering Prayer.</note> God will not give, or for that which he hath not promiſed, or at leaſt not promiſed it in the way, and at the time that thou wouldſt have it; ſo did <hi>Moſes</hi> that ſervant of God pray for that which God would not give him, and then it is in vain to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of God; ſee this in <hi>Deut. 3. 23, 26. Moſes</hi> beſought the Lord that he might not die, but that he might live and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40486:208"/> go <hi>into the goodly Land;</hi> but God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the contrary, and would not anſwer his Prayer, <hi>ver. 26. The Lord was wrath with me for your ſakes, and would not hear me, and the Lord ſaid unto me, let it ſuffice thee, ſpeak no more to me of this matter,</hi> &amp;c. So that when the people of God ask of him things that he will not give them, but hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the contrary, its in vain then to ask, ſee the like, <hi>Jer. 7. 16. Pray not thou for this People, neither lift up cry nor Prayer for them, neither make Interceſſion nor Prayer for them, for I will not hear thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, if thy Prayer be right in all things in this matter, he may anſwer thee and thou not know it. For 1. God does not always anſwer the Prayers of his people in the ſame things they pray for, and yet anſwer them in that which is equivalent, that is as good and better then that which they prayed for, for God knoweth what is good, and giveth the beſt good to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, <hi>Exod. 33. 18. Lord I beſeech thee ſhew me thy Glory;</hi> he asked too much of God, not too much for God to grant, but too much for <hi>Moſes</hi> to receive; if he ſhould have had his deſire, it would have killed him, <hi>ver. 20. And he ſaid thou canſt not ſee my face, for there ſhall no man ſee me and live.</hi> But God anſwered him in that which was better for him in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent capacity, that is, the ſight of his good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs which ſhould ſuffice him till he was
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40486:209"/> capacitated to ſee his glory, <hi>Ex.</hi> 34. 6, 7. So likewiſe <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9. he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thrice to be rid of the <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh the meſſenger of Satan that buffeted him,</hi> and the Lord anſwered him not in the very thing, but in that which was as good and better, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ay strength ſhall be perfected in weakneſs;</hi> and this the Apoſtle took for a good and full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>moſt gladly will I therefore glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me,</hi> &amp;c. So it may be thou haſt prayed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over, again and again, to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from afflictions and perſecutions, and yet they increaſe daily, and thou thinkeſt God hath not heard thee, but if he aſſure thee that his Grace ſhall be ſufficient to bear thee up under all that he hath done, and will bleſs thee with <hi>ſtrength in thy Soul,</hi> that is enough and a gracious anſwer, and that he will deliver in his time, for this he hath promiſed; it may be thou haſt been wreſtling and praying againſt thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature, and crying out as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me?</hi> And when ſhall I be delivered, &amp;c. and yet canſt not be rid of them, but ſome of theſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> do ſtill remain, and ſo thou thinkeſt that God does not hear thee, but if he lead thee thereby, the more to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to ſee the need thou haſt of him, and the ſalvation that is in him, keeping up the warfare ſtill, and keeping humble in
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40486:209"/> the ſenſe thereof, believing the full delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the end; it is a gracious anſwer that will fill the ſoul with joy, <hi>Rom. 7. 25. Thanks be unto God through Jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi> The like may be ſaid in many other caſes, Chriſtians may ſeek good things of God, and he may anſwer them in other things, even croſs to expectation, yet beſt for them; they may ſeek Riches, and he may give them Poverty; they may ſeek proſperity, and he may give them adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they may ſeek life, and he may give them death; and yet give them that which is good and beſt for them.</p>
               <p>Or thirdly, It may be thou haſt not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a right manner, which is ſo neceſſary a requiſite in Prayer (as hath been before ſhewed) as that without it we may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any anſwer from God, that is, to pray with the ſpirit underſtandingly, believing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, humbly, &amp;c. but in thine own ſpirit, if not in thine own name, and then no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if thou haſt no return of thy Prayers from God, for he regardeth the manner as well as the matter of the prayers of his people, he will be ſought in the due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or elſe he will reprove and croſs his people in the ſervice; 1 <hi>Chron. 15. 13. The Lord our God made a breach for that we ſought him not after the due order.</hi> God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to manner and order, in all his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and when his people miſs there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:40486:210"/>
               <p>Or 4ly, it may be thou haſt had wrong ends in thy Prayers, and that hath hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy ſucceſs; there are two great ends to be ſought in our Prayers, that is, the Glory of God, and the good of our ſelves and others; and if thou miſs in the end of ſeeking, thou miſſeſt of all, it may be thou haſt prayed for Conqueſt over thy Luſts, for the increaſe of the gifts and Graces of Chriſt, that thou mayeſt be accounted ſome body in Profeſſion, gifts of Miniſtery, that thou maieſt be Eſteemed and have a Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if God give them, it will be to thy wrong; this is minded, <hi>Jam. 4. 3.

               <p>Fifth and Finally, or elſe ſin may be the cauſe why God doth not hear and anſwer your Prayers; Men Pray and Sin, and Sin and Pray, and wonder why God doth not hear them; but if men allow themſelves in ſin, God will not hear them.

Hezekiah</hi> could ſay, <hi>Remember Lord I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart;</hi> that is, with an upright and ſincere heart, that is the true ſenſe and meaning of the King, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he had many infirmities; 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. And thou</hi> Solomon <hi>my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind;</hi> that is, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, upright, ſound, and undivided heart; for the Lord <hi>deſireth truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſ. 51. 6. <hi>Job</hi> was ſaid to be perfect; that is, upright, ſincere, and ſo owned of God, though he ſaw himſelf to be ſinful, and ſo confeſſeth, <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a comparative perfection<note place="margin">2. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</note> ſpoken of in Scripture; that is, ſome have been, and may be reputed more perfect than others; and ſo ſaid to be perfect, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thoſe that are worſe than them; living in the ſame time and age, and it may be enjoy like means; <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 9. It's ſaid that <hi>Noah was a perfect man in his Generation;</hi> that is, compared with the Generation in which he lived; he was a perfect man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, and upright and ſincere <hi>in his Generation, and walked with God;</hi> that is, kept cloſe with God, and worſhipped him in an
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:40486:214"/> evil Generation; <hi>ver. 5. God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth,</hi> &amp;c. or compared with others that are weaker Chriſtians. Some Chriſtians compared with others, may be ſaid to be perfect, and this I call a comparative perfection; 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 6. Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect;</hi> that is, perfect comparatively with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 3. 1, 2. <hi>And I brethren could not ſpeak unto you as unto ſpiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. not as to thoſe that were ſpiritual, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is all one in ſenſe and ſubſtance; they compared with others, were not ſo ſpiritual or perfect as them: and this is it the Apoſtle minds, <hi>Phil. 3. 15. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded;</hi> that is, compared to others that were more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in their Knowledg, Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, not perfect in the higheſt perfection; for ſo the Apoſtle himſelf was not perfect; <hi>ver. 12. Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect,</hi> &amp;c. So that it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both from Scripture and experience, that there is this comparative perfection, and that in varieties of degrees among all Chriſtians; which are diſtinguiſhed, 1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this perfection among Chriſtians. 2. Among Churches. And, 3. Among Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, yet all are Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Among Chriſtians in general, there<note place="margin">1. Of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> are varieties of degrees, in Knowledg, in Faith, and in Practice, and in all the gifts
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:40486:214"/> and virtues of the new Covenant; this is abundantly cleared by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. to 25. Where he diſcovers the Church in all its parts to have variety of members, as the body of Chriſt, ſome more honourable or perfect than others, ſome weak in the Faith, and ſome ſtrong; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. and 15. 1. Some are comely in their ſpirits and converſations, and ſome need to have comelineſs to be put upon them; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 23, 24. Some ſpiritual, ſome carnal, ſome uſeful and helpful to others, others that muſt be helped along, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 14. Now we exhort you brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded, ſupport the weak, be patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all.</hi> Now it's evident, that it was not (only) the Miniſters or Elders the Apoſtle intended, compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13. But it was the more perfect and ſpiritual members of the Church, that they might know how to behave themſelves towards the more weak and imperfect ones.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are degrees in this perfection<note place="margin">2. Among Churches.</note> among the Churches, ſome Churches are more perfect than ſome, being compared; and that is it the Apoſtle intended in his writing to the Church of <hi>Corinth; He could not write to them as unto ſpiritual, but as unto carnal,</hi> &amp;c. But he ſpake wiſdom among them that were perfect, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 6. But we ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect,</hi> &amp;c. that is, more perfect, and more ſpiritual,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40486:215"/> as the Church of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe <hi>Faith was famous throughout the World,</hi> Rom. 1. 8. and 16. 19. The deep things the Apoſtle writes to them about their freedom from the Law, and ſin, by Jeſus Chriſt, and from condemnation, <hi>by the Law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. So likewiſe the Churches of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Phil. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Rev. 2, 3, Chapt.</hi> Some Churches were more perfect than others, and two of them excelling all the reſt; that of <hi>Smirna, Ch.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10. and that of <hi>Philadelphia, Chap.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Among Miniſters, there is a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial<note place="margin">3. Among Miniſters.</note> perfection ſpoken of in Scripture; 2 <hi>Tit. 3. 17. That the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> &amp;c. That is, the miniſter of God, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo called in the Scripture; 1. Of the old Teſtament, <hi>Deut. 33. 1. Jude 13. 6. 1 Sam. 2. 17. 2 King.</hi> 1. 9, 10.

This is a miniſterial perfection; that is, to be well inſtructed in the Scriptures, and have thence learned how to fulfill their miniſtry; 2 <hi>Tit. 2. 15. Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved unto God, workman that need not be aſhamed, rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the word of truth.</hi> And among ſuch are likewiſe diverſities, and degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In gift, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 11. 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 5.<note place="margin">They differ, 1. In Gift.</note> 
                  <hi>For I was not behind</hi> (that is, in gift) <hi>the very chiefeſt Apoſtle:</hi> which word chiefeſt,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:40486:215"/> implyeth clearly a diverſity in gifts, even amongſt the Apoſtles; for there was no chiefdom by Office, but in Gift <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſeems to excel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In divine diſpoſition to the work,<note place="margin">2. In divine diſpoſition.</note> ſome are more diſpoſed thereunto than others.

They would exclude you,</hi> (or rather us) <hi>that you might affect them.</hi> And the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he ſpeaks of <hi>Timothy, Phil. 2. 19, 20.

               <p n="3">3. In labour and induſtry in the work,<note place="margin">3.

               <p>A fourth ſort of perfection ſpoken of in<note place="margin">4. In <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> Scripture is, when men are well inſtructed in the principles of Religion, relating to matters of Faith and Practice and are truly

It was the fervent labour and prayer of <hi>Epaphras</hi> for the Church, <hi>that they might stand perfect and compleat in all the will of God, Acts 18. 26. Apollo,</hi> though an cloquent man, yet being a godly man, was willing to be inſtructed by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla, in the way of God more perfectly,</hi> and the earneſt Prayer of the Apoſtle in behalf of the Church, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10.

               </p>
               <p>5. There is a Perfection in Juſtification,<note place="margin">5.

Which was the great deſire and endeavour of the Apoſtle, that all believers might live up in it, <hi>That we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that is, perfectly juſtified in him; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. Having forgiven you all treſpaſſes; that is perfect juſtification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where all treſpaſſes are forgiven, <hi>Act. 13. 39. By him all that believe are justified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the Law
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:40486:217"/> of</hi> Moſes; this imputed righteouſneſs to believers is perfect.</p>
               <p>6. As for Sanctification, that is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,<note place="margin">6. In San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</note> 1. Imputed, that is the perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and purity in the perſon of the Son of God, imputed to believers, that is made to them, and accounted theirs; 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Who is of God made to be unto us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption:</hi> and this is perfect Sanctification.</p>
               <p>2. Is holineſs wrought in the Saints, as I minded in the matter of Sanctification, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. And this is both perfect and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; 1. Perfect, in reſpect to the parts of holineſs; that is, there is ſomething of every part of holineſs, of every virtue of Chriſt, in whom holineſs was perfect; and ſo he was the perfect pattern of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his people, and from whom it comes into us; <hi>Joh. 1. 16. And of his fulneſs have all we received, and Grace for Grace:</hi> that is, of every virtue that was in Chriſt, have his people received a meaſure, by which there is (ſutable to the reception) a conformity to him, and a bearing his image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this World: on this account it is they are ſaid to be <hi>Created after God in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4. 24. And in this reſpect the Saints are perfect in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> in reſpect of the parts thereof. A child when he is born into the World, hath all the parts of a man, and ſo is re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puted a man in reſpect of parts, though
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:40486:218"/> not in reſpect of growth and ſtature.</p>
               <p>So believers in reſpect of growth up to the perfect ſtate, ſo they are imperfect, and greatly imperfect too, and are (or ſhould be) growing daily in all the parts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. The Apoſtle preſents this ſame truth by the ſame ſimily, <hi>When I was a child, I ſpake as a child, I underſtood as a child, but when I was a man, I put away chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh things:</hi> he uſeth this ſimily, to hold forth the childiſh, and perfect ſtate of Chriſtians: they are children, though but little ones, yet they are perfectly ſo; yet imperfect in reſpect of the higheſt degree, or growth to the perfect ſtate; and that is it the Apoſtle intends, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 12.</p>
               <p>2. Things propounded, that the higheſt<note place="margin">2. The higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this life.</note> degree of Goſpel-perfection is not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this life; and to demonſtrate this truth, and make it plain, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The declared experience and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Saints in Scripture record, which the Reader may in theſe Scriptures take knowledg of, 1 <hi>Kin. 8. 46. Eccl. 7. 20. Jam. 3. 2. 1 Joh. 1. 8. 10. Joh.</hi> 40. 4, 5. and 42. 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 5. All which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the truth of this matter; the moſt eminent of the Saints that lived in the World, yet were ſenſible of ſin and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſome of them declared it to be the ſtate of all; <hi>Not a man on earth that liveth, and ſinneth not:</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> a
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:40486:218"/> man of the higheſt attainment in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, yet confeſſeth himſelf not to be perfect; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. And that we have every virtue but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are yet in the imperfect and fallen ſtate, only coming forth by Faith, and the beginning work of regeneration wrought in the ſpirit of the mind; the people of God after believing, are but in the way to the perfect deliverance; perfection is for the perfect reſtored ſtate of the Saints: and indeed, were it not ſo, we might ſay as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 19. If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> ſo, if our higheſt perfection were in this life, we ſhould be (comparatively) but miſerable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this perfect ſtate of the Saints will not, cannot be, till the ſecond coming and Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus: it's true, when the body returns to the duſt, the Saints ſhall ceaſe from ſin, and they ſhall be with the Lord: but this is not their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, though it would be a bleſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, if it were poſſible to be attained here; but perfection will not, cannot be, till our Lord come again from Heaven: the truth of this appears from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Phil. 3. 20, 21. Col. 3. 4. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 2. Read theſe Scriptures, and underſtand.</p>
               <p>2. The reſurrection from the duſt will not be till our Lord doth come again in
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:40486:219"/> Glory, 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 23. And till then we come not out of the falen ſtate, <hi>The laſt enemy to be deſtroyed is death.</hi> While we lie in the grave, our bodies are in the loweſt degree of the falen ſtate; and for any to pretend perfection while in the falen ſtate, a ſtate of ſin, ſickneſs, ſorrow, and death, muſt flow from ignorance, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, or both.</p>
               <p>4. That though perfection is not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the higheſt degree, in this falen, mortal, ſinful, ſorrowful, and imperfect eſtate; yet it is the duty, diſpoſition and concernment of all perfect Chriſtians, to be preſſing forward after perfection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> To what end is it to preſs forward after that which is not to be attained in this life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In my anſwer to this queſtion, I ſhall mention three things; 1. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, if they preſs forward after any thing, that is of God and Chriſt, that is of the new Covenant; it muſt be perfection, it is not imperfection they reach after, too much of that they have already in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which makes them groan in the ſenſe thereof; therefore if they preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward after any thing, it muſt be Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>2. By preſſing forward after Perfection. I intend a growing up into a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the perfection attainable in this
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:40486:219"/> mortal ſtate; for (as hath been ſhewed) there are degrees of Perfection attainable here, both in Knowledg, Faith, Love, and an holy conformity to our Lord Jeſus, in the Gifts and Virtues of the Holy Spirit; 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. And this is it the Apoſtle minds, <hi>Phil. 3. 10. That I may know him,</hi> &amp;c. That is, that I may grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the knowledg of him, and in a conformity to him, for he knew him in part before. O, it's a ſign of a gracious ſoul, that is truly longing and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the higheſt degree (attainable here) of conformity to Jeſus Chriſt; 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 3. He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf as he is pure:</hi> that is, maketh Chriſt the copy and pattern after which he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>3. By preſſing forward after Perfection, I intend that the godly ſoul principled with perfection, have in his eye the higheſt and glorious perfection; and that is it he would attain, if poſſible, though he knows it's not attainable here, yet he reacheth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and can do no leſs, if intereſted in it; it is his portion, and that is it the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle intends, <hi>Phil. 3. 11. If by any means I might attain unto the reſurrection of the dead;</hi> that is, to that perfection that ſhall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the reſurrection of the dead; <hi>ver. 12, 13, 14.

               <p>SIncerity being that which crowns all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther virtues and duties (for without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity all is nothing) and muſt have its place and uſe in all relating both to God and Man, without which it is unaccepted with God; and although I have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given hints of this virtue in other Chapters, and particularly in that about Prayer, in the manner how it muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, yet I ſhall in this place ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more diſtinctly, yet briefly. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a virtue ſo well pleaſing to God, he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth truth in the inward parts, Pſal.</hi> 51. 6. man would not accept of hipocritical ſervice or ſhew of love, if he knew it ſo to be,; how much leſs will God accept of that which is but feigned and in ſhew; God knoweth the heart, the mind, and thoughts, and he will have the heart in all, or nothing at all, <hi>My Son give me thy heart;</hi> God will accept no gift without the heart, let God have the heart, and he hath all, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the heart he will accept nothing.</p>
               <p>All the glorious ſhews in Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the heart, are but Painted ſins, and the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:40486:221"/> perſons but as <hi>Whited Tombs, that appeas beautiful to men, but within are full of Dead men Bones.</hi> Sincerity muſt have its place in Faith, or elſe it is but feigned and nothing worth, true faith muſt be <hi>unfeigned, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 5. its to be feared that there is a great deal of feigned Faith in the World, that makes men no better then Hypocrites. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 23, 24, 25. Sincerity muſt have its place in love, (or elſe its nothing) and that 1. to God the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37. to Jeſus Chriſt his Son, <hi>Eph. 6. 24.

                  </hi> To the people of God for his ſake it muſt be ſincere heart love, <hi>Mat. 22. 39.

Give ear unto my Prayers that goeth not out of feigned lips.</hi> In a word, Sincerity muſt be in all our ſervices if they are accepted of the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. Pſal. 119. 34. Give me <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and I ſhall keep thy Law, yea I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart,</hi> ver. 69. <hi>I will keep thy Precepts with my whole heart,</hi> and 9. 1. <hi>I will praiſe thee with my whole heart;</hi> ſo that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be faith or love, prayer or praiſe, or any part of obedience, it muſt be with the heart, a ſincere heart, a whole and undevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded heart, a heart and a heart the Lord diſowneth.</p>

               <p>I ſhall indeavour to ſhew ſome infallible<note place="margin">Signs of ſincerity.</note> Characters of a ſincere heart, plain from Scripture, and Saints, Experience, not to darken truth, or leave Souls at a loſs, but that he that runs may read and underſtand. And in general, as the ground of the whole, a ſincere heart is an <hi>honest heart, and good heart, Luk.</hi> 8. 15. this honeſt and good heart includes the whole of ſincerity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An honeſt, good, and ſincere heart,<note place="margin">1.

Let us walk honeſtly as in the day,</hi> &amp;c. The honeſt ſincere ſoul loves the day, he is not for night work, nor deeds of darkneſs, be it never ſo ſecret. <hi>Joh. 3. 19 20, 21. He that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God.</hi> The ſincere ſoul loves the light, becauſe it diſcovers the darkneſs of ſin, the ſincere ſoul fears all ſin, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hypocriſie, he would not be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite for the world, and therefore comes to the light.

                  </gap> his work is, ſo he doth it ſincerely and throughly; he is in good earneſt in the matter, and therefore do not only ſearch himſelf, and is willing to be ſearched by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but is willing to ſtand to the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

Search me O God and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wickedneſs in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> O this is a ſincere honeſt heart indeed that would have all darkneſs diſcovered and brought to his knowledge, and to that end deſires the Lord to ſearch and bring to light any hidden way of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and darkneſs. But the Hypocrite dwells in the dark, and is afraid of the light, he covers himſelf with darkneſs, he thinks men ſee it not, nor would he have God to ſee it, he dares not make a ſearch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into his heart and ways, much leſs would he have God to do it, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This honeſt ſincere heart is a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:40486:222"/> to imbrace every truth of the Goſpel for truths ſake, to have a reſpect to all Gods Commandments, <hi>Pſal. 119. 6. Then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have a reſpect to all thy Commandement,</hi>; the ſincere ſoul (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his light) do not half it with God or with men, but as <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb, Num.</hi> 14. 24. and 32. 12. <hi>Being men of another ſpirit they follow God fully,</hi> and what they know not they beg light from him, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Pſal. 119. 33, 34. Teach me O Lord the way of thy Statutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end, give me underſtanding and I ſhall keep thy Law, yea I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart;</hi> a ſincere heart as he is univerſal in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, ſo is he careful of out-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning truth, moves not ſudden, but on ſound and ſollid ground, he would not miſcarry for a world, to take errour for truth, <hi>Pſal. 119. 128. I eſteem all thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every falſe way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Hypocrite at beſt does but half it with God, and with men, leave ſome ſins that are moſt ſcandalous and leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but keep ſome ſins cloſe and faſt ſtill, as his <hi>Dallilah,</hi> that he will not part withal; touch his Darling, beloved, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſin, then he ſtartles, be it cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, oppreſſion, pride, or whatever elſe that muſt not be medled with, like <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> who heard <hi>John</hi> the Dipper gladly, and reformed ſome things; but when he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:40486:223"/> the Darling Luſt, he muſt ſuffer for it; ſo it is likewiſe with the Hypocrite in matter of ſervice, he will do ſome duties, ſuch as like him and may ſtand with his credit and profit, but is not univerſal; do not deſire to know, that he may do, and ſo indeed is not upright and honeſt either with God or Men, for the Hypocrite can ſin out of ſight, lye and cheat for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, without any conſcience at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The honeſt plain ſincere heart car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth<note place="margin">

This is the deſign of the ſincere heart in all his undertakings both towards God and Men; and this is Gods deſign in all his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, eſpecially on the new Covenant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, his own Glory and ehe Salvation of Sinners, and this the ſincere heart is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled with. <hi>Pſal. 119. 55. I have remembred O Lord thy name in the night, and have kept thy Law;</hi> that is a good keeping of the Law of God that flows from the remembrance of his name, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. There was a book of remembrance written for thoſe that <hi>feared God and thought upon his name.</hi> The ſincere ſoul in all his ſeekings, ſeeks God and Chriſt as the chiefeſt good, and ſeeks the Glory of the Name of God, and his own and others Salvation. <hi>Pſal. 119. 94. I am thine, ſave me, for I have ſought thy Precepts.</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Saints of old ſought a
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:40486:223"/> Country, <hi>Heb. 11. 14. They that ſay ſuch things plainly declare that they ſeek a Country.</hi> The Saints may, yea, they ought to be ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Heavenly Country, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly City, and to have <hi>reſpect to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, ver.</hi> 26. to their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the ſalvation of others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 33.</p>
               <p>But the Hypocrites deſign is to keep up a viſible Profeſſion for his own honour and eſteem among men, deſigning himſelf in all, making his Profeſſion a Cloak to cover his ſecret Abominations, either covetouſneſs as <hi>Judas,</hi> they make it <hi>a Cloak for Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 5. Or for <hi>Malitiouſneſs, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 16. or at beſt deſigns his own honour and eſteem with men, <hi>for they love the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God.</hi> But ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſouls can acquit themſelves of ſuch things, and abhors ſuch deſigns as theſe, but deſigns to approve themſelves to God, whatever men think, ſpeak, or do againſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A ſincere heart is conſtant with God,<note place="margin">4.

               </p>
               <p>But the Hypocrite is much for timeing

               <p n="5">5. The deſign of the ſincere heart is to<note place="margin">5. Deſign to pleaſe God.</note> pleaſe God in every thing that he doth, and to approve himſelf to God, he will chooſe rather to croſs the wills of the whole world then the will of God, and yet will pleaſe men too, ſo far as may be, and not diſpleaſe God; ſincere Chriſtians in their non-conformity to the world, it is not to pleaſe their own fancies and humours (as ſome imagine) but it is to pleaſe God, to live to his word and will, <hi>Gal. 1. 10. Do I now pleaſe men or God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If I pleaſe men, I ſhould not be the Servant of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 1. <hi>That as ye have received of us, how ye ought to walk and pleaſe God,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Joh 2. 22. 2 Cor. 2. 17. That is a Son-like frame indeed, that deſigns to pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:40486:224"/> diſpleaſe God for a world, he had rather diſpleaſe men, and himſelf too (I mean fleſhly ſelf) then diſpleaſe God.</p>
               <p>But Hypocrites deſign is to pleaſe men, and to pleaſe their own humours, they do what they do to be ſeen of men; the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite if he pray; it is to be ſeen of men, if he give, it is to be ſeen of men, to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of men, that is his end, and if that be attained, he hath his reward, <hi>Mat. 23. 5. But all their works they do to be ſeen of men, ch.</hi> 6. 1, 5. The Hypocrite if he can keep but juſt ſo much Religion as may continue his eſteem among the Profeſſors of his way and time, he looks no more, unleſs it be the vain glorious, gloſſing, talking, (and it may be) preaching Hypocrite.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The great care of a Sincere Chriſtian<note place="margin">6. Look e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to the heart.</note> is to look to the heart, to have the heart right with God, he knoweth <hi>that the heart is deceitful,</hi> and that God requireth the heart, and will have the heart or nothing; and therefore <hi>whatever he doth, he doth it heartily as to the Lord;</hi> and mourns when he finds the heart wanting and wandering; he hates a divided Hypocritical heart, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth with the heart, loveth God with the heart, prayeth with the heart, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. he accounts no ſervice well done where the heart is wanting.</p>
               <p>But the Hypocrite is a ſtranger to heart work and heart ſervice, he troubles not
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:40486:225"/> himſelf with that work, the moſt he doth is to bring his body to the ſervice, and his head it may be, but for the heart he take; no care for that, he is a ſtranger to ſuch work, <hi>Ezek. 33. 31. VVith their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs,</hi> See Mat. 15. 8. Pſal. 78. 36, 37. <hi>They did flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed to him with their Tongues, for their heart was not right with him; Thus the Hypocrites in heart heap up wrath,</hi> Job. 36. 13. For Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie lyeth in the heart, and Sincerity is in the heart, it is an honeſt and good heart.</p>

He that knoweth God heareth us, he that is not of God heareth not us; hereby know we the ſpirit of truth and the ſpirit of errour,</hi> 2 Joh. ver. 9. <hi>Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, hath not God; but he that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the Doctrine of Christ, hath both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Hypocrites whatever they pretend in word, of owning the Doctrine of Chriſt, yet eaſily turn from it, preferring their own inventions and imaginations equall with, if not above the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>Mat. 15. 7.

               <p>God takes them to be Hypocrites that pretend to own him and his word, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed own the Precepts of men, and their own inventions in his worſhip.</p>

We may eaſily judge what love ſuch have to Jeſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles (if they were alive, they ſhould quickly find and feal their love) that are ſo friendly to their followers in Faith and Patience; thus did the Hypocrites of old <hi>Mat. 23. 29, 30, 31.

God (in Chriſt Jeſus) covers the many failings, and accepts the weak ſervices of his upright ones; <hi>David</hi> a man of many failings, yet being upright and ſincere, he was owned of God to be <hi>a Man after his own heart:</hi> ſincerity of heart makes us after Gods own heart, he delights in, owns, and approves of ſincere ſouls, he takes them for his own, with all their weakneſſes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Sincerity of heart towards God in the faith, gives great boldneſs to the ſoul before the Lord, both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But the Hypocrite faints and ſinks when God deals with him, <hi>Prov. 28. 1. The wicked flee when none purſue, but the righteous are bold as a Lyon.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Hereafter in the day of accounts, the great day of the Lord, who may abide it; ſincerity then will be worth the world, then ſhall the righteous, ſincere upright ones, <hi>ſtand with great boldneſs before the Lord, 1 Joh. 4. 17.

It will preſerve from ſin, it is a wonderful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving vertue, a ſincere heart would not ſin againſt God for a world, it not only preſerves from the common ſins of the time and place, but from the ſins of mens callings and relations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from the ſins that men are by nature moſt inclined unto, <hi>Pſal. 18. 33. 23.

               </p>
               <p>2. It will keep the ſoul conſtant and cloſe to God is duty, it makes conſcience of every duty and ſervice, private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and keeps the ſoul in a right frame in
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:40486:229"/> the performance thereof, that is, holy, humble, awfull, believing, and rejoycing in the Lord, its that will tend to compleat the ſoul in all the will of God; ſincerity goes through with the work, does not half it with God, nor turn back in the day of tryal, but the Hypocrite is fleeting, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, <hi>will not pray always,</hi> doth nothing in conſcience and love to the Lord, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to private work and duty he is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, looks not at the frame of his ſpirit in the work, but is too and fro, faſt and looſe with God, ſuitable to the time, occaſion, and advantage of Profeſſion.</p>

                  </label> of the ſincere ſoul from the Hypocrite, is plain and full, yet I ſhall mention two or three things more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſincere ſoul dreads to be a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, he would not be a Hypocrite for all the world, he fears Hypocriſie as he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſin; this is the experience of all
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:40486:229"/> ſincere Chriſtians, they watch their hearts in this matter, and keeps up a holy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of themſelves, becauſe they know that the heart is deceitful and treacherous; and therefore prayeth as the Prophet. <hi>Pſal. 1 19. 29. Remove from me the way of lying, and grant me thy Law graciouſly, and in a gracious ſincere heart;</hi> he knows that whatſoever is done in Hypocriſie, will prove but a lye in the end, and therefore dreads to be a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and ſaith as the Prophet, <hi>v. 163.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to diſtinguiſh between being a Hypocrite and Hypocriſie; Hypocriſie is a ſin of nature that all are inclined unto; there is the ſeed of all ſin in the nature of it, in the Saints, and but in part mortified, the difference lyeth in this; the ſincere heart deſireth and deſigneth truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in all, he would not be a Hypocrite nor have any hypocriſie to have any being in him, but the Hypocrite deſigns Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and ſo profeſſeth himſelf to be what he is not, and doth, or eaſily might know himſelf to be a Hypocrite.</p>
               <p>The ſincere heart watches himſelf in the matter to find it out, and warreth againſt it, and mourneth in the ſenſe of his natural inclinations on that account; he judgeth it, and loaths himſelf for it as for any other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: Pride and Hypocriſie will be appearing, but its the ſouls grief, and his deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is againſt it.</p>
               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:40486:230"/>
               <p>But the Hypocrite is in his Element, let his deſign be anſwered and he hath his end, he troubles not himſelf about ſin cerity, or if at any time conſcience accuſe, he ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches not to the quick to find out the truth of the accuſation, in order to deliverance, but ſtills and ſtifles convictions, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſilences conſcience, laying it to ſleep without any cure of the malady.</p>

My manner and method of ſpeaking to this great truth ſhall be, 1. To ſhew from Scripture what Election is; Election is the chooſing and deſigning of ſome out of the lump of mankind, for the end by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor determined; I take Election, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing and chooſing, to be all one in ſenſe and ſubſtance, and theſe are the Scripture terms about the matter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. &amp; 11. 2. 5. 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>To Elect or chooſe in the common ſenſe of all men, imports a taking of ſome, and leaving others, it cannot import the electing and chooſing of all, as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, for in common ſenſe, that is no choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing where all are taken, for where ſome are choſen others are left, <hi>Mat. 22. 14. Many are call'd but few are choſen;</hi> ſo that in the common ſenſe of all men, divine and humane, we muſt underſtand Election to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:40486:231"/> be a chooſing of ſome perſons out of (or from among) many, to the end determined by the chooſer.</p>
               <p>2. That God hath elected and choſen<note place="margin">2. That God hath elected ſome.</note> ſome for himſelf from among men, and that before the world was, <hi>i. e.</hi> from Eternity; this appeareth from Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 2. Elect according to the fore knowledge of God the Father,</hi> &amp;c. or fore-ordained, as the ſame word is rendred, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. or fore-decreed, or as its rendred, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Fore-know, whom he did fore-know,</hi> &amp;c. that is, decree or ordain, and this for knowledge, ordaining and decreeing about the ſalvation of ſome men and women muſt be before time, <hi>Eph. 1. 4. According as he hath choſen us in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world,</hi> that is, from Eternity, it is Gods eternal willing or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to ſave ſome in the way by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> This choice ſeems to be in time, for they are <hi>choſen in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and none are accounted to be in him before and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its one thing to be actually in Chriſt by faith, and another to be elected and choſen in him before the world was; faith is the demonſtration, and (in ſome meaſure) the accompliſhment of this choice or election, which was in Chriſt Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began, or for his ſake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, ver. 5. <hi>Having Predeſtinated us,</hi> (or before ſet us apart) <hi>unto the adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:40486:231"/> by Jeſus Christ to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> Where is a Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination unto the Adoption of Children, before the Adoption was accompliſhed, and that <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> which he purpoſed in himſelf; and its without all queſtion, that in all things, and in relation to all perſons, about this great work of Salvation, <hi>He worketh all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the councell of his own will, ver.</hi> 11. And why ſhould we not believe the truth of God in relation to Election before time, (it being ſo plainly ſtated in Scripture) as well as believe the truth of that word, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. In hope of Eternal life, which God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye, promiſed before the world began;</hi> If God made promiſes to us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began, why ſhould we think it ſtrange for him to elect or chooſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the world began? 2. <hi>Tim. 9. Who hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Christ Jeſus before the World began;</hi> all which demonſtrates this truth, that true believers are, but what they were Elected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to before they were, and that they do, nor ſhall enjoy any thing but what was promiſed them in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World was.</p>
               <p>But 2. If we ſhould let it paſs for currant as ſome would have it, (which we may not doe) that is, that Elect perſons were not
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:40486:232"/> in any ſence conſidered as in Chriſt Jeſus, before and without faith, yet the choice was <hi>before the foundation of the World;</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained to believing, to ſanctification, ſo that it anſwers not the end for which it is objected.

               <p>3. That this Electing, Chooſing, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing, and Ordaining love of God, was (as reſpecting the perſons ſo choſen and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected) without any reſpect to any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen faith, or grace, or good in them, as the preceeding meritorious cauſe of election, (if any meritorious cauſe at all, it muſt be in Chriſt Jeſus, in whom and for whoſe ſake the election was) the truth hereof appears; that it was not for our goodneſs, faith, or holyneſs, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9.

Becauſe in reaſon it cannot be, for Election and choice was before time, and ſo could not be on the condition of what we had not, we were not, nor had not ſaith when Elected, therefore faith would not be the conditional cauſe of an act paſt in God before the ſuppoſed condition thereof was in being, that could not be either the meritorious or conditional cauſe of ſuch an act; ſo that its evident that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was of Grace and not of Work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Juſtification is not till we believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the truth.</p>
               <p>4. To what perſons are elected, and that<note place="margin">4.

Elect,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Through Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience:</hi> Obedience as the end, which includes faith and love, and all the divine vertues and duties of the Goſpel, <hi>through</hi> (or by) <hi>the Sanctification of the Spirit;</hi> hence faith is ſaid to be, <hi>The faith of the operation of God, Col. 2. 13. Eph.</hi> 1. 4. The end of the eternal choice is deſcribed to be, <hi>That we might be holy, and that we might ſhew forth the praiſes of him that hath called us out of darkneſs
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:40486:233"/> into his marvellous light, 2 Thef. 2. 13. God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, Jam.</hi> 2. 5. By all which it appears, that the end of God in his Electing grace was, that he might have a holy, obedient people, that might ſhew forth his praiſe, and be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally ſaved and glorified in the world to come.</p>
               <p>5. How perſons may come to know<note place="margin">5. How men may know their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> their Election of God, and that they are of the number of his Elected ones; God hath in his word opened a way by which his people may in a good and comfortable meaſure know their Election, 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 4. Knowing Brethren, Beloved, your Election of God.</hi> But how may we know our Election of God? <hi>Anſw.</hi> When Gods ends of Election are effected in us, by that we may and muſt know it, if ever we rightly know it, when Faith, Love, Holyneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is effectually wrought in us, by that we read our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the effects of electing Grace wrought in us, and this the Apoſtle clears, having aſſerted their knowing of their Election, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. he diſcovers how they came to know it, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. by the effectual work of the Goſpel in them, <hi>Gods ſhedding abroad his love in the heart,</hi> and uniting the heart to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in truth of faith and love, is the alone way by which Chriſtians may read their Election. So the Apoſtle for himſelf, 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. declares himſelf to be <hi>an Apoſtle, after the Faith of Gods Elect.</hi> And how does he prove
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40486:233"/> that? <hi>By the acknowledgment of the truth which is after Godlineſs:</hi> and perſons that pretend to know their Election of God any other way, deceive themſelves.</p>
               <p>6. The Reaſons why God Elected ſome<note place="margin">6. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why God elected ſome.</note> to Salvation before the world was, are, 1. his love, his ſpecial love; its true that God had a love to all mankind, for they were, and are his, he made the nature of all in the firſt man, and determined the being or perſons of all in time, and loved all, <hi>Joh. 3. 16. God ſo loved the world that he gave his Son,</hi> &amp;c. But herein is diſcovered his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial everlaſting love, <hi>Jer. 31. 3. Yea, I have loved thee with an everlaſting love,</hi> &amp;c. and this is the new Covenant love, a promiſe of Goſpel grace to the Spiritual Seed, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>Chap.</hi> 30. 10. to the end, and <hi>chap.</hi> 31. throughout, here is the great and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love of God and of Chriſt, who <hi>loved the Church and gave himſelf for it,</hi> Eph. 5. 25. Even the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church of the First Born, whoſe names are written in Heaven,</hi> Heb. 12. 23.</p>

               <p>REprobation I take to be non-election, and I dare not underſtand it further; for ſo here is Mercy and Juſtice wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted in a way of righteouſneſs: I do not find reprobation, as attributed to God, in this matter, in the terms thereof in the Scripture; and (I ſuppoſe that) all the ſayings in the Scripture that ſeems equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to it, may be very ſafely underſtood in this ſenſe; as <hi>Prov. 16. 4. He made the wicked for the day of wrath, i. e.</hi> he knew they would be wicked, yet he made them, and deſigned them for their wickedneſs unto wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21, 22. The elect he deſigned unto honour, and others he left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the means afforded, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue impenitent, he deſigned to diſhonour; for God ſaw the end of all, and diſpoſed all to ſuch ends as will be for his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>Jude, ver.</hi> 4. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>certain men that were of old ordained to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;</hi> that is, God fore-knowing them in their ſins, ordained them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: I dare not think that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated any, but in relation to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. Of the Church of Chriſt in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</head>
               <p>THE Church of God, under the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Law, or old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſo the Nation of the Jews to them was the Oracles and Ordinances given, and them did he own for his peculiar people to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, his people in Covenant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his diſcipline and government.</p>
               <p>The Church of God under the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the new Teſtament, ſince the death and reſurrection of the Teſtator, Jeſus Chriſt, are, or ſhould be, the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> that is, true Believers, both of Jews and Gentiles. It's now no National Church, but a people gathered out of the Nations, to the profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and obedience to him, <hi>Gal. 3. 28, 29. Act. 10. 34, 35. Rom. 3. 29. Rev.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak more diſtinctly of the Church, the word Church (or Aſſembly, as the Greek word <hi>Ekkleſia</hi> imports) is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly applied in the Scripture, to any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, bad as well as good; <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 32,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:40486:239"/> 39, 41. The ſame word is ſo tranſlated, and applied to an Aſſembly met together for evil.</p>
               <p>But when it intends the Church, and aſſembly of God, and of Chriſt, on the new Covenant account, (that being it we are now about) we may conſider it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture, on a three-fold conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>1. It intends a people gathered out of<note place="margin">What the conſtituted Church of Chriſt is.</note> the World by the miniſtry of the Goſpel, to the viſible profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and obedience to him, to Faith and Holineſs, the Goſpel conſtituted Church of Chriſt; and this is the Church I eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially intend to ſpeak of, the viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Church of Chriſt; and this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into ſeveral bodies, or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Aſſemblies, under the regal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt their Lord, yielding profeſſed ſubiection to Jeſus Chriſt in his Laws and Ordinances, as far as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed therein; every particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation having the ſame power from Chriſt their Head and Lord; not one to Lord it over another, but to help and aſſiſt in love: and the Church of Chriſt is thus gathered into many particular Aſſemblies, by reaſon of diſtance of place, number of perſons, that they cannot aſſemble in one, or a few Aſſemblies, but in as many as are neceſſary for their coming together, and comfortable ſerving of the Lord. That the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:40486:239"/> Church of Chriſt is, or ſhould be gathered thus, appeareth, <hi>Act. 14. 23. 1 Cor. 1. 2. Gal. 1. 2. Rev.</hi> 1. 4. All which proves the truth aſſerted; and that they had all of them the Ordinances of Chriſt adminiſtred in each Aſſembly, as appears evidently by the Apoſtles reproof and direction on this account, about matters of Order and Ordinances, as relating to particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and 14. Chapt. <hi>Tit. 1. 5. Phil. 1. 1. Rev.</hi> 2 and 3 Chapt.</p>
               <p>And this Church in all its particular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies is gathered out of the World, and from the World, to the Lord, by the Word and Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Matt. 28. 19, 20. Mar. 16. 15, 16. Act.</hi> 2. 41, 42, 47. and 4. 4. and 13. 48, 49. This was the Apoſtles commiſſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 17, 18. Which work was alwaies accompliſhed in this way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and contrary to the humane power, who ordinarily hath oppoſed this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant work of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>(And what-ever Church it is that takes any other Lord or Law-giver beſides Chriſt in religious things, and owns an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane head either in its conſtitution by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, or receiving Laws in matters of Faith and Worſhip, is none of Chriſt's Church, but an Harlot, <hi>a Sinagogue of Satan, who ſay they are Jews when they are not,</hi> Rev. 2. 9. Committing ſpiritual fornication with the Kings of the Earth, after the manner of the Whore of <hi>Babilon, Rev.</hi> 17. 2. and 18, 9.
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:40486:240"/> Taking the humane power as Head, Lord and Law-giver in Chriſts concernments, making them their ſtrength, ſupport and uphold, perſwading the Magiſtrate to perſecute all that fall not in with them; who, although Chriſt hath ordained that his Church ſhould be ſubject to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane powers, in humane and worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, yet this is that with which few are ſatisfied, being otherwiſe perſwaded by the falſe Church, who delighteth in fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and loveth to have another Head and Lord than Jeſus Chriſt.)</p>
               <p>And the Churches of Chriſt thus ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and conſtituted under Chriſt, their Head, Lord, and Law-giver, have an equal power from him, with their diſtinct offices to carry on all the adminiſtrations of his Kingdom; that is, his Church, according to the rules by him preſcribed; and in theſe Churches is God to be worſhipped in all his appointments, in ſpirit and in truth, <hi>Joh. 4. 24. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>And theſe viſible conſtituted Churches of the Goſpel are (or ſhould be) all Saints, true Believers; they do bad ſervice, who, to maintain their National Churches, and all Chriſtendom, (as called) to be the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal viſible Church, would perſwade us that the viſible Church of Chriſt have in it multitudes of Hypocrites; though it's true, that Hypocrites have been, and it's like are, and may be in the true Church of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:40486:240"/> Chriſt, yet they have no right, and muſt give an account for their being there, <hi>Mat. 22. 12. Luk.</hi> 26. 27. And ſurely they do bad work, and draw a bad concluſion from the premiſes; that is, becauſe Chriſt's Church may have Hypocrites in it; they will pretend a Church for him, of openly profane, and ungodly Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>But to prove that the viſible conſtituted Churches of Chriſt are, or ſhould be true Believers, this appeareth;</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the way of entrance, which is by Faith, Repentance, and Baptiſm, <hi>Matt. 28. 19, 20. Mar. 16. 15, 16. Act.</hi> 2. 39, 41. None muſt enter but in this way, to let us to know, that none elſe ought to be there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the proviſion made for them, when they are come in, that they may find feeding for their ſouls, according to the promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 9. That is, his holy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments that lead to him who is the true Bread of Life, for their building up in the Faith till they come to Glory, <hi>Act. 2. 42. Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. And truly we cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, nor religiouſly imagine, that he hath given ſuch Gifts, and left us ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to build up a company of profane and godleſs perſons; I think they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane thoughts in thoſe that think it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The order he hath left in his Church to exclude Hypocrites, when diſcovered, evidently declares that he never intended
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:40486:241"/> to have a Church of Hypocrites, <hi>Matt. 18. 15, 16, 17. 1 Cor. 5. 7, 8, 13. 2 Tit.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It appeareth by the Titles given to the Church of Chriſt, they are called Saints, that is, holy ones, <hi>ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints, holy Brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, the body of Chriſt, and members in particular, a choſen Generation, a royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, an holy Nation,</hi> &amp;c. With many like expreſſions, all which do more than evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrate, that Jeſus Chriſt never intended to have his Church to be a den of Hypocrites, and cage of unclean and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful birds, but to be an holy people, to ſhew forth his praiſe in the World.</p>
               <p>This is the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt in this World, though not of the World; and thoſe powers on earth that oppoſe his rule and government, by his Laws in his Church, are very bad neighbours to him; he is content to let them have the outward regality, and his ſubjects (on that account) to be ſubject to them, and is a good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to them, and will do them no wrong, but good all their daies, if they would but be friendly to him and his; for by him it is that Kings Reign: but if they will not permit him his right, what will be the iſſue, is eaſy to be diſcerned, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>2. The word, Church of Chriſt, does ſometimes intend all true Believers in the World, whether in or out of particular conſtituted Churches; and this is it which
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:40486:241"/> is ſo commonly called the inviſible Church, which is indeed in ſome ſenſe inviſible; that is, none can certainly know the true believers, but God alone (2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The Lord knoweth them that are his</hi>) and none elſe, no not themſelves, ſome of them, and at ſome times; yet in ſome ſenſe the Church thus conſidered is viſible in the world, and do viſibly own the Lord, according to the meaſure of means and light enjoyed; the Church thus conſidered I take to be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom. 10. 11, 12, 13. 1 Cor. 1. 2. Eph.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. where the Church is called, <hi>The body and fulneſs of Christ, Col.</hi> 1. 24. and as it is without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that in all ages many of the viſible Church in profeſſion have miſcarried, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none of Chriſts body truly, the Church taking its denomination from the better part, though all ought to be ſuch; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are in charity to judge, that many may be out of the right conſtituted viſible Church and Churches of Chriſt (that are Members,) though its none of their virtue ſo to be; God hath his people in <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18. 4. and his Church (on this account) hath he had in the <hi>world, throughout all ages, Eph.</hi> 3. 21. although for a long while, but little of viſibleneſs, according to Goſpel rule did appear, and that is it I underſtand is intended, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1, 2. Where the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers are meaſured rather by the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſs of their inviſible Worſhipping,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:40486:242"/> then by the rule of their Ordinances, Order and publick bearing up the name of Chriſt in this matter, being <hi>troden under foot of the Gentiles,</hi> that is, of the Babyloniſh and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian world, and this is it I take to be the Univerſal (and in ſome ſort) viſible Church of Chriſt in the World, the body of which all true believers are Members.</p>
               <p>3. The word Church ſometimes intends all the elect of God, and this is the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church (as to man) and this is evident from the Scriptures, <hi>Eph. 5. 25. Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Church</hi> (before it was viſible) <hi>and gave himſelf for it,</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. we read of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church of the firſt born,</hi> &amp;c. the Church in this ſenſe includes all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, but it is the bounden duty of all true believers to get themſelves into the viſible Profeſſion of Chriſt, and bearing up his Name in the World, according to the rules by him preſcribed, and the higheſt and beſt light they have, or may attain therefrom in this matter, and to be under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, in ſome particular conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Church of his.</p>

As there is no King but hath his Laws by which he rules, ſo Chriſt our Lord and King hath his Laws by which he rules in his Church, which is his Kingdom, and a government diſtinct from all humane and worldly governments, and admitteth not of any mixture of humane inventions or ordinances of men, nor of any humane power to inforce to the obedience thereof, <hi>Mat. 15. 9.

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:40486:243"/> Chriſt will have his Subjects like thoſe, 2 <hi>Cor. 8 3. Willing of themſelves;</hi> that is, without humane conſtraint, and <hi>ver. 12. If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not;</hi> and this is a truth in all caſes of Chriſts ſervice in firſt liſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under him, <hi>ver. 5.

               <p>God hath in all his Adminiſtrations throughout all ages, had his inſtituted Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, by which his people, (his Church) was diſtinguiſhed from others, and in the obſervation of which they did viſibly own God in the World, and the truth is, that the inſtitutions of God in matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, have been the Badge of diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Church and the world through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages, and the cauſe of all the woe and miſery that hath come on mankind, and on the people of God, hath been for the tranſgreſſion of inſtituted Ordinances: <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion of an inſtituted Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, brought in death and miſery in all mankind, and all the Plagues and miſeries brought on <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, was for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the inſtituted Ordinances of God in the matters of his worſhip; See 2 <hi>King</hi> 17. 7. to 20. all the miſery and wrath

               <p>The Lord Chriſt having <hi>appeared in the latter end of the world, to put away ſin by the offering of himſelf,</hi> he being the ſubſtance of all former inſtitutions, they leading to him, <hi>Col. 2. 17.

               <p>The Laws, Ordinances, and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt for his Church, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to ſerve and worſhip him in, are as followeth.</p>
               <p>1. Baptiſm (after believing, repenting,<note place="margin">1. Is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</note> and turning to the Lord) is the firſt duty
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:40486:244"/> required, <hi>Mat. 16. 15, 16. Acts</hi> 2. 38. 41. and is the imitating Ordinance into the viſible Church and kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and is the duty of all true Believers; and there is no other way or door of enterance decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt, but by Faith and Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Not by natural generation or birth as ſome imagine, that is done away, as being of the old Covenant, where the natural ſeed were accounted for the ſeed, <hi>Gen. 17. 7. ver.</hi> 14. but in the New Covenant the ſpiritual ſeed, that is, believers are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſeed and ſubjects of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and are to live under his laws, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 28. nor by entring into Covenant as ſome others imagine, which is after their own deviſing, miſtaking and miſapplying the Scriptures, as that 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 5.

                  </gap>s, to the Church by ſome Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is a clear and palpable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, its true in the firſt ſentence; that is, they gave themſelves to the Lord, may be included their giving themſelves to the Church by Faith and Baptiſme, for thoſe who give up themſelves to be the Lords Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="469" facs="tcp:40486:244"/> of the Saints in their neceſſities, and that beyond what the Apoſtles hope was, conſidering their <hi>great affliction and deep po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> that this is the true meaning of that Scripture is ſo plain, that he that runs may read it; ſo that I know no other way of enterance into the Church and viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, but by Faith and Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Neither underſtand I well what they mean that call Baptiſm a Covenant, and talk ſo much of a Baptiſmal Covenant; its a language the Scripture knows not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know I any other Covenant then the Goſpel new Covenant of Grace, which (on our part) is a willing conſenting (from believing the truth of the Goſpel) to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Jeſus Chriſt, and to be ruled by him as Lord and King; which faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is to be confeſſed in order to Baptiſm, by which the believer viſibly gives up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Lord, as to be ſaved, ſo to be ruled by him. What other things are held forth in Baptiſm, its meet for Chriſtians to be inſtructed in, as the waſhing away of ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16. that is the pardon and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging away of ſin by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>not the waſhing of the filth of the fleſh, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good conſcience toward God, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21. Yet the waſhing of the fleſh is a figure of that within, and a Conformity to Chriſt in his Death and Burial, thereby ſignifying our Death to ſin, and our natural death likewiſe, to confirm our Faith in the truth of the Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5, 6.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:40486:245"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. and why Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord (which is the ſecond inſtituted Ordinance that I ſhall mention) ſhould be ſo frequently called Seals as they are by ſome, I know not, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture knows no ſuch things; ſome calls themſelves to Seal Gods love to the ſoul, and the believers intereſt therein. As to this its true, the love of God and Chriſt is abundantly held forth therein, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever exerciſing faith, may (and I hope do) meet with refreſhing and ſealing conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein, and ſo he doth in other of the inſtituted Ordinances of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Word and Doctrine of the Goſpel, but without the exerciſe of Faith, he profits by neither, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. Others ſay, they are Gods Seals to confirm his truth in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to us, and that God never ſets Seal to the truth of any mans intereſt, that we muſt look to our ſelves, whether we have the faith to which the Covenant is made; God ſeals to that, he will not fail in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the Covenant on his part, which have ſomething<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of truth in it; <hi>i. e.</hi> it behoves us to look that our faith is right, and God will not fail in performance of his Covenant of life; but its true like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that God hath and doth ſet ſeal to the truth of his peoples faith in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his Grace, elſe they can have no ſeal but their own, which muſt needs prove invalid in the day of need; if Gods ſeal and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:40486:245"/> theirs concur not in the matter. <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The ſpirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with</hi> (or to) <hi>our ſpirit, that we are the Children of God;</hi> the ſpirit of Chriſt is the alone ſealing evidence to the hearts of Chriſtians, and that by his word and work in them, <hi>Eph. 1. 13, 14. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 22. this is ſuch a Sealing evidence to the hearts of Chriſtians, as that who ſo have it not, is none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. and to call any of his Ordinances, Seals, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all Scripture rule, as for the truth of God in his Covenant, I think we cannot have more confirming Seals then his Word and Oath, <hi>two immutable things in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18. and the gift of his ſon from Heaven for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners that believe and obey him. What greater and ſurer ſeals theſe (I know not) of the truth of God, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit working and effecting Faith, in and by thoſe Sealing evidences of his love to men, is the Sealing <hi>Earnest of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Supper of the Lord is an inſtituted<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:40486:246"/> God and Chriſt to men, being therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. and the great ſin in thoſe that partake thereof, is, in not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords body; that is, the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords body, and the ſhedding of the Lords blood for our ſins, and the greatneſs of the Lords love therein, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29. it being an Ordinance that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth Jeſus Chriſt Crucified (with all his benefits) to the eye, that the eye may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the heart; for all good comes to the heart, by the ear and by the eye; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel comes to the heart, by the ear in hearing, and by the eye in ſeeing and reading; this Ordinance is for the eye that the heart may be affected, and for the taſte and ſtomach, that the ſenſe of hunger and feeding may be of ſpiritual uſe, to learn the ſoul to feed on Chriſt, who is the bread of Life, in which we may obſerve the Wiſdome of God to make uſe of our ſenſes for our ſpiritual good, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
               <p>This holy Ordinance is for the holy people of God, the Church, his holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who alone (by true Faith) are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in this Crucified Jeſus, who ever eats and drinks thereof, without intereſt therein, eats and drinks damnation to themſelves. What ſad and bad work then do they make that will bring in all, make up a Church of multitudes of Hypocrites to damn them, as if the deſign of God and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:40486:246"/> Chriſt in the Goſpel had been to get in multitudes into the Church on purpoſe to damn them; ſuch will have a ſorry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the great day who thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Lords end in his Death, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and defile his Church and holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>3. Ordinance and Inſtitution of Chriſt<note place="margin">3. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> in his Church is, the Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for Building up of the Church in their <hi>moſt Holy Faith,</hi> as all the Ordinances of Chriſt are. There is a two fold Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, the firſt for converſion and gathering into the Church, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 15, 16. Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38. and 26. 16, 17, 18. The 2. for building up of the Church in the holy Faith after Converſion and Gathering; <hi>Mat. 28. 20. Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. this being the end of Gods giving gifts to men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. They are bad Miniſters who turn the World into the Church without repentance and Faith, and ſo build up a multitude of Hypocrites and prophane perſons inſtead of the Body of Chriſt; neither Jeſus Chriſt, nor deceived poor Sinners will thank them for it in the end.</p>
               <p>4. Ordinance of Chriſt in his Church,<note place="margin">4. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> is Prophecy, much ſpoken of in Scripture, though I fear I may ſay its almoſt loſt out of the Church; but of this I ſhall ſpeak more diſtinctly when I come to ſpeak of
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:40486:247"/> the Officers in the Church, though I take not this of Propheſie to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as an Office by an Officer as ſuch, but by a gift.</p>
               <p>5. Ordinance is Prayer; although its<note place="margin">5. Prayer.</note> true, this is not for the Church alone, but is the duty and property of all believers, as ſuch <hi>Col. 4. 2. 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. yet it is a Church Ordinance, <hi>Acts 2. 42. Where Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, breaking bread, and Prayers are ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as the great and common Ordinances of the Church, in which they had fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip together, in 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1. Epheſ. 6. 18. Jude verſe</hi> 20. which in the Church (as all other of Chriſts Ordinances are) is to be performed by men and not by women, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. See more about this of Prayer, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>6. Praiſing God or ſinging Praiſes to<note place="margin">6 Praiſing.</note> him, is an Ordinance of Chriſt in his Church, as well as the duty of all Saints at all times, See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 15, 16. where both Prayer and Singing are mentioned as it ought to be performed in the Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. the manner is expreſt to be ſuch, as in Prayer, one to ſpeak to the Praiſe of God, ſo that the reſt may joyn in with him to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> as in Prayer, for all to ſing in Meeter together, is that for which there is no rule (that I know) in Law or Goſpel. In the Old Teſtament Singers were appointed to that ſervice, 1 <hi>Chron. 9. 33. Ezr. 2. 65. Neh.</hi> 5. 67. and did perform
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:40486:247"/> it by turn, anſwering each other, 1 <hi>Sam. 18. 6, 7. Exod.</hi> 15. 20, 21; But I judge that Old Teſtament Singing is ended as to the manner thereof, and I am ſure there is no rule in the New, for that which now by moſt is practiſed.</p>
               <p>Goſpel Singing ſhould be new Songs by a new People, ſutable to the new Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 1. and 98. 1. ſuch Songs as none can learn but the Redeemed ones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3. no marvail if ſuch as are for Forms of Worſhip in Prayer and Praiſe, be for a Formal people void of the Spirit and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Spiritual Worſhip.</p>
               <p>And as this is an Ordinance, ſo it is a gift in the Church of Chriſt, as Prayer is, and is ſo to be performed, a hearty giving thanks for mercies received, ſo as that the reſt may ſay <hi>Amen;</hi> that is, joyn in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which is expreſt in ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> as in Prayer, they are greatly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken who think that there is no Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in Meeter, and with a Singing Tone.</p>
               <p>7. Ordinance of Chriſt in the Church is,<note place="margin">7. Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> Church Diſcipline, Order and Government, and the Adminiſtring Church cenſures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as occaſion and need calls for it; and herein is the Royal and Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſt, in an eſpecial manner kept up in his Houſe, his Church, his Kingdom; which conſiſts in the execution of his Laws upon Tranſgreſſors in all caſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:40486:248"/> of the Goſpel, and firſt planting of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Church, being endued with power for ſuch a work, to give laws and directions from Jeſus Chriſt, for his Churches directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Faith and practice, till his ſecond coming, but ſuch Apoſtles we now have none, but they were and are our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, we being of the ſame Goſpel Church.</p>
               <p>Though according to the common ſenſe of the word Apoſtle (that is ſent) ſo we have, or might or ſhould have Apoſtles in the Church, it ſignifying a meſſenger, or one ſent; as I ſhall more fully declare in its place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prophets, now this of Prophets I<note place="margin">2. Prophets</note> take not to be a diſtinct ordained Office, as Paſtor and Teacher, but a gift in the Church, and ſo an Ordinance of Chriſt for the Churches Edification, not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary any more then the other Miniſtry that we account to ſtand as the Ordinary Miniſtry in the Church; probably the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Primitive times might have more and greater gifts then any now, but that Nulls not the gift nor uſe thereof in the Church, no more then that becauſe, the Paſtors and Teachers then had greater ſpiritual gifts then any now have. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould have no Paſtors nor Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers now, and ſo no Church, and ſo no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; thoſe who work Prophets out of the Church, might by the ſame reaſon and
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:40486:249"/> rule, work out all and themſelves too; that by Prophets were intended ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for the edification of the Church (what ever gifts they then had) will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was a gift to be obtained by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and endeavour (extraordinary prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was an immediate gift) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31. and 14, 39.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was a Gift for the common good and Edification of the Church, moſt of profit, (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Gifts ſingly Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred without Office) in the Church, therefore not to be loſt or expulced out of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet it was (in ſome ſenſe) inferlour to that of Preaching by Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that is called to Office, is not only a Prophet, but more then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and this will appear if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all the Prophets work was to ſpeak by way of Edification, Exhortation, and Conſolation; but the Elders or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers work and duty, was, and is, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, Reprove, Rebuke, with all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 2. Titus</hi> 2. 15. which none out of Office might authoritatively doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Doctrine of the Prophets muſt be judged and tryed, as ſuppoſing they might ſpeak amiſs and fail (but the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are ſuppoſed to have attained to ſuch
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:40486:249"/> a degree of knowledge in the School of Chriſt, as that there is no ſuch rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for them) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29, 30, 31. not that Officers or Elders are without all limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this matter, but under the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Propheſie was ſuch an Ordinance in the Church of Chriſt, as that the Church it ſelf might be too apt to deſpiſe it by reaſon of its meanneſs, as is implyed, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 19. 20. Quench not the ſpirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not Prophecyings;</hi> it ſeems they were all for Preaching, but deſpiſe Prophecyings, as it is too much at this day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Prophets might through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bring forth ſomething that was not good or true, yet not to be deſpiſed, <hi>v. 21. Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> Which implyeth, that there might drop ſome things from the Prophets that might not be good, yet it ſhould not be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nor they diſcouraged, but that which was good imbraced, and that which was bad left, and the Prophets inſtructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for their amendment.</p>
               <p>All which proves that the Prophets were ordinary gifted perſons in the Church for Edification, after its firſt gathering, till Officers were choſen, and the Officers was to be choſen out of the Prophets, that is to ſay, the beſt gifted and quallified among them, and this anſwereth the order. 1. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Secondarily Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. and this was
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:40486:250"/> the rule obſerved, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1, 2. And out of theſe Prophets and Teachers, muſt <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas and Saul be taken,</hi> for more publick work and ſervice; and if this rule were obſerved in the Churches, it would be a way (according to the Lord's Order) to raiſe up gifts in the Church fitted for Office, as occaſion calls for it; for this of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is a conſtant order in the Churches to be continued Prophets, and an official Miniſtry may (and ſhould) be together in the Church; ſo would not the Church be without perſons gifted and fitted for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as need requireth.</p>
               <p>The next out of the Prophets, are Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,<note place="margin">3. Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</note> Goſpel cryers, or Goſpel preachers, or Apoſtles, that is, ordinary Apoſtles: this is an office of great uſe in the Church, though almoſt left out, and loſt, as if it were extraordinary, and only for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times; the reaſon thereof rendred, becauſe there are no ſuch Gifts now, nor Apoſtles to call them to the work, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in it. A wonderful weak way of reaſoning; by the ſame rule we may reaſon out all offices and officers out of the Church, yea, and reaſon out Church and all, for want of Apoſtles and Gifts; and here lieth the great reaſon of the ſeekers loſs, want of Gifts, and gifted perſons, as the Apoſtles, to adminiſter Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and this is next of kin to it; for the ſame reaſon that works out Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:40486:250"/> will (if followed) work out all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there were ſuch called, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Officers and Miniſters belonging to the Church, not extraordinary, (as the firſt Apoſtles) but ordinary, not infallibly inſpired, but ſuch as received all their rules, relating to their work, from the Apoſtles, as the Paſtors and Elders did both in their miniſterial work, and in converſation, 1 <hi>Tit. 2, 3, Chap.</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 11, to 16. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. throughout; and 6. 11, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14, 15; 16, 22, to 26. So the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> proves the ſame, with many others that might be mentioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the ſame uſe and need of ſuch a Miniſtry to preach the Goſpel to the World, for converſion and gathering, and to take care for the eſtabliſhing of the Churches, and Officers therein,; which, as it is Gods order in his Churches, ſo would it be a mercy and a bleſſing to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and much loſs hath befaln the Church in the neglect hereof: ſuch a miniſtry (if ſpirited for the work) would be of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral advantage to the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That their call unto it was ordinary, that is, in the primitive times, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Churches; for there was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Miniſters, but ſuch as was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately called, as the Apoſtles were, and all Officers in the Church beſides Apoſtles, were and are ordinary, and to continue. That they were ſo called to it, is clear;
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:40486:251"/> 
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> was called to this office, <hi>by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> 1 Tit. 4. 14. And theſe ſort of Miniſters were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſometimes Evangeliſts, <hi>i. e.</hi> Goſpel Preachers, or Cryers, 2 <hi>Tit. 4. 5. Act.</hi> 21. 8.

The Apoſtle calls <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his <hi>brother and companion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and your Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> that is, the Churches Apoſtle: by all which it appears, that this official Miniſtry was ordinary, and ſhould be in the Church ſtill, and the Church ſuffereth much in the loſs thereof; for Gods Ordinances are not in vain; and out of the Prophets in the Church ſhould this and other Miniſters be choſen, according to the order ſtated, <hi>Firſt Apoſtles, then Prophets, and then Evangelists, and Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> Eph. 4. 11. This is the method of God's Order in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. Where Evangeliſts in the term are left out, but very probably included in that of Teachers, that inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the official Miniſtry, beſides the firſt Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were not inferior Apoſtles, yet in as much as their call was not from the mouth of Chriſt in the manner as the reſt was, they muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>2. Out of the Prophets are Paſtors and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:40486:251"/> Teachers to be choſen by the Church, and ordained; and although there be various Titles given in Scripture to theſe Officers, as Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It imports not variety of Offices, but the fulneſs of the work, every Title being ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, Paſtor to feed, Teacher to inſtruct, Elder to rule, Biſhop to overſee; it's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that all may be in one man, but in as much as theſe gifts may be more eminent, ſome in one, and ſome in another, ſutably ſhould they be exerciſed.</p>
               <p>That thoſe Titles hold not forth any diſtinction in Office, or variety of Offices, or any ſuperiority in Office one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in way of authority, though in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction by gift, doth appear, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. Where the Apoſtle firſt calls them Elders, <hi>ver. 5. For this cauſe left I thee in</hi> Creet, <hi>that thou mighteſt ordain Elders,</hi> &amp;c. and after, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Biſhops; <hi>for a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. By which it appears, that Biſhops and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are one and the ſame Office, 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. The Apoſtle ſums up all the Miniſtry of the Church on this account, under the Name of Biſhop, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 17. under the Name of Elders; by which it appears, that Biſhops and Elders was one and the ſame Office, only Elders diſtinguiſhed, by ruling and teaching, which diſtinguiſheth not the Office, but the exerciſe therein, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the gift, both in teaching and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; the like diſtinction we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:40486:252"/> 7, 8. diſtinguiſhed by the Gift more than by the Office. Elders may have a gift to teach well, and rule well too; others may have a gift to rule well, and teach but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; or teach well, and little gift to rule; and ſutable ſhould they be exerciſed in the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. Theſe ſorts of Officers are all included in that of Biſhops; and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. They are all included in El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who were Paſtors to feed the flock, <hi>ver. 2. Acts 20. 17. Paul</hi> calleth the <hi>Elders of the Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>to him;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Calleth the ſame Elders, Biſhops, Overſeers; and <hi>Peter</hi> calleth himſelf <hi>an Elder, and a Witneſs of the ſufferings of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 1.</p>
               <p>So that if any will ſuppoſe a ſuperiority in Office among thoſe varieties of Titles, there is leaſt ground of all for that of Biſhop; for <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf ſaith, that he was an Elder, but he no where calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Biſhop; and Ordination was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Presbytery, not Epiſcopacy, 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 4. 14. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 7, 17. They are ſummed all under that of rule, and guides; and theſe Officers are to carry on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of the Church in an orderly way, though the power of all is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 20. Yet the Church are to chooſe out ſuch perſons as God hath gifted and qualified for the Work, that although the gift be from the Lord, yet the authority of adminiſtring
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:40486:252"/> muſt be from the Church electing, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of the Presbytery, by Faſting and Prayer, and impoſition of hands, <hi>Act. 13. 3. 1 Tit. 4. 14.

Who were the firſt Officers ordained in the Church, and were ordained Elders: though their work was to take care of the poor, yet they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Elders. 1. All Offices was in the Apoſtles, next to Jeſus Chriſt, they were Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Elders, Deacons, did all, and were all, as is evident in this firſt Church, and all other Officers and Offices came from them, as neceſſity called for it; and the firſt Office and Officers ordained in the Church, were thoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and were ordained Elders; though then eſpecially to take care of the poor, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did before, and Elders ſtill may do, if the work be not too much for them: that they were ordained Elders, is apparent; 1. In that we read of no Officers in that Church, but Apoſtles and Elders, <hi>Act. 15. 6. ver.</hi> 22. The whole are ſummed up in three diſtinctions, <hi>i. e. Apoſtles and Elders, and the whole Church,</hi> ver. 23. <hi>Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren;</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 30. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution was <hi>ſent to the Elders by the hands of</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul: and without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, it was ſent to them that had the care of that matter, and here they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Elders: I mind this the more for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that election of Elders belong to the Church; the Apoſtles, though infallible,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:40486:253"/> would not rob the Church of this right; ſee <hi>Act. 14. 23. When they had ordained them Elders</hi> (by election, or lifting up of hands) <hi>in every Church, Cheirotoneſai,</hi> to chooſe by holding up the hand, to create by general voice of ſuffering; and thus all Officers, <hi>i. e.</hi> Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers, muſt be choſen by the Churches, and by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, be authoriſed to the work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19. 23.</p>
               <p>And Officers when thus choſen, and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> apart to the office and work, are to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter all Ordinances in the authority of Chriſt, yet ſo as to have the Church with them in the work; and the Church is to encourage them, and be ſubject to their adminiſtrations in the Name of the Lord, while they abuſe not their authority; and yet they are to be accountable to the Church, in caſe of male-adminiſtring, or abuſe of power and authority; and the Church who authorized them, may again deveſt them of their authority, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reformation, or in caſe of ſcandalouſneſs in converſation.</p>
               <p>Yet not withſtanding this, in matters of rule and order, they ought not to ſeek ſo much to pleaſe men as to diſpleaſe the Lord; for they are the Lords ſervants, (as well as the Churches,) and muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do all things according to the pattern and right rule, and to pleaſe the Lord, to whom they muſt give an account,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:40486:253"/> though men be diſpleaſed therewith, and in caſe they ſuffer from men on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yet they will have Peace with God and in their own ſouls.</p>
               <p>Two things I fear are much wanting in the Churches. 1. A Spirit of Government in the authority of Chriſt, as Wiſdom, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, Courage, Meekneſs, Love, and the fear of the Lord. 2. A Spirit in the Church to be Ruled and Governed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in caſe of need we read of helps, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. Helps Governments,</hi> in as much as all power is inveſted in the Church, in caſe Officers be wanting, till they may be obtained; the Church hath authority to appoint ſuch as are moſt ſuitably gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either upon tryal in order to Elderſhip, or as helps in caſe of need to carry on all the Adminiſtrations of the Church, or where are Officers, being ſick, or a way, or weak with age, the Church may do the like; <hi>i. e.</hi> appoint helps to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in Government, or any other of the Adminiſtrations of Chriſt in his Church.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſort of Officers in the Church<note place="margin">4. Deacons.</note> are Deacons, whoſe work and office is to look after the neceſſities of the poor, and to make a juſt diſtribution of the Churches Treaſure committed to them on that

               <p>This is an honourable ſervice and work of the Lord, the poor being in the Church in the room of Chriſt, to prove the truth of his peoples love to him, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Me you have not always with you, the poor you have always with you.</hi> You may ſhew your love to me, in loving them, when I am gone, and in doing good to them; hence Chriſt will ſay at the laſt day, <hi>I was naked and ye cloathed me, hungry and ye fed me, Sick and in Priſon, and ye viſited me,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>4. Without this, wronged perſons in matters of cenſure could have no redreſs
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:40486:257"/> but muſt lye under their oppreſſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy, (which is that which ſome have aſſerted, that if a Church caſt out its beſt Members unjuſtly, that there is no help, a horrid principle to be huſhed out of all Chriſtian Society) which would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Church and Government of Chriſt more obnoxious and dangerous then any humane Government (which in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes admitteth of appeals, on ſuppoſition of Male Adminiſtrations) and uncomfortable for any ſerious ſouls to come into the Church, who probably ſome time or other may fall under a <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> without all hope or help.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall yet propound ſome further weighty Scripture grounds for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this practice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The many Scriptures that gives us very much light in this matter, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 2, 3. in the caſe of the difference at <hi>Antioch</hi> about Circumciſion, the Church appealed to the Apoſtles and Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the whole Church, as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. with <hi>ver. 23. The Apoſtles, Elders and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> which was the whole Church; ſo in the caſe of the Inceſtuous perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. the Apoſtle determines the matter, and they follow his advice, See <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 1. &amp;c. about the matter of Marriage, and putting away of the unbeliever; about which they had written to him, he reſolves the caſe, and that not altogether in way of power
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:40486:258"/> without the Church, as is evident, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 24. Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy.</hi> So he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the caſe of the diſorderly Members, 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. 6. 1 Joh. ver.</hi> 9, 10. in the caſe of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> evil Adminiſtration of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, caſting out ſuch as he ſhould not, <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I come, I will remember his deeds which he doth,</hi> &amp;c. Now what in ordinary caſes the Apoſtles did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the Miniſters and Churches may and ought to do now, in like caſes, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patterns for all times, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, in the Adminiſtrations of the Church, and for the preſervation of the peace and purity of the whole, <hi>Mat. 28. 20. Teaching them</hi> (that is, the Church Baptiſed Believers, with their Miniſtry) <hi>to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> So that the Churches have as full power from Chriſt for preſervation of the whole, in their Loyalty to him in Purity and in Peace, as the Apoſtles had, which is a full and warrantable authority in this matter.</p>
               <p>As an illuſtration of this matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to this purpoſe is that of the two Tribes, and half building an Altar; <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. 10. which was an act (in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) contrary to the Law of God, and ſo a matter of fact to be inquired into, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. with <hi>Lev. 17. 18. Deut.</hi> 12. 5, 6. and the reſt of the Tribes ſent <hi>Pheneas,</hi> and ten
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:40486:258"/> Princes with him, to inquire after the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to lay (as they judged) ſin to their charge; and thoſe Tribes owned their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the matter, and gave them a good account to their ſatisfaction, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. thoſe Tribes had no Lordſhip given them over each other, yet was it their duty to look to each other, that the Law of God was not tranſgreſſed, and to execute the Law in ſuch caſes. The like we read about the abuſe of the <hi>Levites</hi> Wiſe, <hi>Judg. 19. 20. chap.</hi> on his complaint they all, as one man, joyn in the matter to avenge the ſin; by all which it appeareth, that the Church of God throughut all ages hath had this power to rebuke ſin, and maintain truth, in dealing with either perſons or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in caſe of ſin, according to the rule of the preſent miniſtration, under which they lived, and without repentance, to withdraw Communion from them, and in their obſtinacy in an evill way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This likewiſe comes under that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8, 9. it is juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and lovely, makes for Purity and Peace, for the Churches to be ſubject one to another (as it behoves Members) in this caſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
               <p>So that then it follows, 1. That Church which refuſeth to be accountable of any of their actions to their neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (being deſired on complaint of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages)
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:40486:259"/> on this ground, that they have no power to inquire after any of their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that they are accountable to none but God, do hereby make a breach upon the Law of relation, and exclude all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from their fellowſhip, and ſo ſtand by themſelves alone.</p>
               <p>2. That ſuch a Church is no more fit for the Communion of Churches, then a Member in a particular Church, that will not live under the Law of the Relation, and will be accountable to none but God; a principle that makes perſons not meet to live among men, much leſs in the Society of the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. That (on the grounds ſtated) it is the duty of the Churches in caſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of ſcandal, in Doctrine, Diſcipline, or Manners, of any particular Church in the ſame fellowſhip, to make dilligent and ſpeedy inquiry into the matter, that they may thereby ſhew their love to, and zeal for the Glory of God, the purity and peace of his Church; the good of the offenders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and preſervation of themſelves from the guilt of others ſins.</p>
               <p>4. That if any Church come under a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or complaint of miſcarriage and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall in Doctrine, Manners, or unjuſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and refuſe to give an account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being tenderly deſired, or to clear up the matter in a juſt way (that is, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Offenders and offended, with their
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:40486:259"/> witneſſes, to be heard before the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches, or their Miniſters and Members appointed for that ſervice) the Churches ought to withdraw their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from ſuch a Church, to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pure from their ſin: whatever is a juſt ground for one Church to exclude a Member, is a juſt ground for a Church to be excluded in like caſe; and this is a juſt ground to exclude a Member. 1. Report, and complaint of ſcandalous ſin. 2. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inquired after, a poſitive refuſal to give an account, eſpecially before the witneſſes that accuſe. 3. A denying the power of the Church to make inquiry and to deal in the matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If ſuch a perſon be fit for fellowſhip in a particular Church then ſuch a Church may be fit for the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of Churches, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. So that in a word its evident, that its not only the Churches ſin that refuſeth to be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her Neighbour Siſter Churches, but that the Churches do ſin in neglecting or delaying to call ſuch a Church to account (which is under complaints, reports, and jealouſies of ſin in any caſe) in not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their duty to God or men; nor can they acquit themſelves before the Lord, untill they have impartially done their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this matter: that it is a duty, and to be done in Chriſts authority, is clear and full, from <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. or elſe they muſt leave Chriſts authority, or leave the work whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:40486:260"/> undone, which is contrary to the true ſenſe and reaſon of the Scripture, as hath been before proved, or do it in their own will and authority.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is there any ſuch thing as pride in apparel? or any ſuch thing condemned in the Scripture, as pride in apparel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I propoſe this queſtion, and the ſame to that of covetouſneſs, becauſe I perceive Chriſtians run to exceſs in theſe things, without all care or fear, as if there were no ſuch ſins in the World, a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous evil of our times, Chriſtians ruſh into it, as if riches, gay clothes, and following the faſhions of the times, were the only preparations for another World; or if not, as if they expected no part therein, but to have their portion only in this life.</p>
               <p>But ſurely it is a ſin condemned by the Lord, not only in the old, but in the new Teſtament; in the old, <hi>Iſa. 3. 16, 17. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

What they are you may ſee in that which followeth: by which we may ſee, that the Lords people hath alwaies been addicted too much to this ſin, and eſpecially the female Sex; and this we find at preſent by woful experience amongſt profeſſing people, though contrary to the Word of God, and the Spirit of Grace (in the hearts of gracious ones) 1 <hi>Tit. 2. 9, 10. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 3, to 6. In both which Pride is forbidden, <hi>and modeſt apparel, with ſhamefac'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſobriety, as becometh women profeſſing Godlineſs,</hi> is commanded; and the truth is, that this ſort of Pride is a ſhame, and a ſhameful ſin to be found in the Church of Chriſt; <hi>Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. 25.

It behoves the Churches to purge out this ſin as an abomination, (and to be cloathed with humility, which adorns the new Covenant) leſt the Lord caſt them out, <hi>as an abominable branch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O, if we could, or would be every one ſtriving who ſhould be moſt like Chriſt, and conformable to him, as we are ſtriving to be like the World; how glorious would
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:40486:267"/> Chriſtians be in their profeſſion, over now they are: but now unhappy we, whoſe care is to be like the World, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are the more unlike our Lord, and ſo diſhonour him, and wrong our own ſouls: and that which adds to this ſin is, that Miniſters, who ſhould cry aloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe abominations, either practice the ſame themſelves, or allow it in their Families and Relations; are ſilent in the matter at beſt, and others ſhameleſs enough, plead for it, and ſurely that is the Devils work: no wonder then if it grow to a mighty torrent both of ſin and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some it may be preach it down in word, but allow it in practice in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Families, as if they had a licenſe to be licentious in this matter.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved this evil in Parents, that hath been bread plain themſelves, (and it may be ſo continue) but breed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to pride and vanity, as if they deſigned them to deſtruction, and ſay (it may be) they cannot help it: let ſuch know, that they ought to command their children, and remember <hi>Ely</hi> in like caſe, for his weak and ſoft dealing with his Sons, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22, to 27, 33.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved the Husband to go plain himſelf, but the Wife arraied like a Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player; and the vain man it may be is proud to ſee his Wife ſo fine, or if not, paſſeth all by in ſilence, or complains that
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:40486:268"/> he cannot rule her; ſhe will have it ſo, ſay what he will.</p>
               <p>An argument that the man knows not how to rule, and ſo draws the guilt of his Wives ſin upon himſelf; or that the Wife knows not her duty either to God or to her Husband: and indeed, thoſe who have no conſcience of duty to God, it cannot be expected that they ſhould have conſcience of duty to man.

               <p>5. Contentions and diviſions about need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and invented things, is a ſign of a proud heart, when perſons form up things to themſelves which the Lord never required, and make that a ground of diviſion for ſelf-ends; ſuch things as theſe being the cauſe of moſt of the diviſions at this day, it flows from ſelf and pride: <hi>Prov. 13. 10.

               <p n="1">1. God trieth the Faith of his people,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>I ſhall now only anſwer two objections or queſtions about this matter, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be true indeed, that God and <label type="milestone">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Without all controverſie it <label type="milestone">

                  </label> ſhould not be ſo with them, were they fit for another ſtate, its not for want of love or good will in God, that his people muſt be chaſtiſed, but it is in love and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the Lord doth it, or permits it to be done, its for their good, as hath been before ſhewed; Parents correct their Children for their good, and not their hurt, in love to amend them, and not to harm them, though Children think the contrary; he doth it for their profit, <hi>To make them partakers of his holineſs, that they may not be condemned with the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He will try them (as I ſaid before) the truth of their Faith, Love, Patience, and Conſtancy; and great reaſon it ſhould be ſo, for the truth of our Lords love to us was tried to the purpoſe, and that too in the way of his Suffering for us, and he was content to ſuffer and bear hard and heavy things for us, without grudging and repining; and its meet our loves ſhould be tryed likewiſe, <hi>therefore let us arm our ſelves with the ſame mind.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>2. Its eaſie and light, compared with the Yoke of Sin and Satan, which makes men to take great pains to do wickedly, and very often deſtroy their bodies in the Service

               <p>3. To truly gracious Souls that love the Lord Jeſus in Sincerity, there is nothing ſo heavy a burden to them as ſin, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as the ſervice of the Lord, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings too, when they live the life of Faith and love; ſin is their burden, and the want of a ſuffering frame of ſpirit is their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but Grace and Holineſs, and a Heart fitted to conform to Chriſt in every thing, and to follow him where ever he leads, that is the delight of the gracious ſoul.</p>
               <p>Note this as a ſpecial diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> between a gracious Sincere Heart, and a Hypocrite, or Formaliſt; the burden of the Hypocrite is, that there is ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that there are ſuch duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſuch ſins to be avoided, and ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to attend the Goſpel; and this is his burden. He goes on heavily, and at a hard rate, and in all could gladly turn back again; if ſelf eſteem and credit with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and legal conſcience would permit, and many poor ſouls waiting for a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of drawing back, ever and anon break through all, and return as they were; this we ſee by wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:40486:276"/> according to that word, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>But the Sincere Chriſtian rejoyceth in the Service, <hi>and hateth the ſin that doth ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily beſet,</hi> loves the holineſs of God, and the purity of his Word and Worſhip, but is burdened and grieved that he comes ſo ſhort in the right performance thereof, he quarrels not at the ſtrictneſs or holineſs of the ſervice, but with himſelf that hath ſo much averſneſs in his nature thereunto; <hi>He rejoyceth that God hath accounted him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer ſhame for his name ſake,</hi> but is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with his own carnality, and coming ſhort in the right ſuffering ſpirit of the Goſpel.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX. Of Death, and the State after Death; of the Reſurrection and Judgment.</head>
               <p>COncerning Death I need ſay but little; not only the Scripture aſſures us of the certainty thereof, that <hi>it is appointed for men once to die;</hi> but common experience confirms the truth hereof, we ſee it dayly, that all men dye, it is the way of all fleſh, great and ſmall, noble and ignoble, good and bad, all die, except thoſe (of the Saints) that ſhall be found alive at the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord, they ſhall be changed, which will be a death to the body, though not aſleep in the grave, but a ſudden change 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51. and many of the wicked ſhall not then die, <hi>but be caſt alive into the Lake of Fire, Rev.</hi> 19. 2. But alas, who is that ſo layeth it to heart, the certainty and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs thereof, ſo as to be preparing and prepared for it, as doth concern them that prayeth with the <hi>Prophet, Pſal. 39. 4. Lord make me to know mine end, and the meaſure of my dayes, that I may know how frail I am,</hi> and Pſal. 90. 12. <hi>So teach us to number our dayes that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom;</hi> ſo as
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:40486:277"/> to be always ready when ever the time comes.</p>
               <p>2. Concerning the State of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<note place="margin">2. Of the State of men after death.</note> after Death, their bodies return to the Duſt, according to the Word of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. and muſt there remain till the Reſurrection; and to the Saints its counted and called <hi>a ſleeping in Jeſus,</hi> and indeed its a ſleep to all, both good and bad, ſo called, becauſe there is a lying down as to ſleep, and ſhall be a riſing again as men out of ſleep, <hi>Dan. 12. 2. They that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake,</hi> &amp;c. and their ſpirits returns to God that gave them, <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 7. Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> The Spirits of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (by divine ordinance) immortal, ſhall not die, but return to the Lord; <hi>i. e.</hi> to his diſpoſal untill the Reſurrection; and as for the State of the Spirits of men after death, what light I underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giveth us herein, I ſhall endeavour briefly to diſcover.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the State of the Spirits of the<note place="margin">1. Of the Saints.</note> Saints, the Scripture ſeems clear, that the place to which they go, and where they ſhall abide till the Reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is to a place above in Heaven called Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, ſignifying a place of reſt and pleaſure, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 2, 4. ver.</hi> 2. the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>third Heaven,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 4. explains it to be Paradiſe, which is the place of reſt for
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:40486:277"/> the Spirits of the Deceaſed Saints, and not the higheſt Heaven, the glorious habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God and Chriſt, which is ſaid to be <hi>far above all Heavens, Eph.</hi> 4. 10. into the higheſt Heaven none are, nor may enter, at leaſt till the Mediatory office of Chriſt be finiſhed, ſo it was in the Type, none might enter into the moſt holy place but the High Prieſts only, and Chriſt only is <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into Heaven it ſelf,</hi> and by himſelf to perform his Mediatory Office; that this place above called the third Heaven and Paradiſe, is the place where the ſpirits of the Deceaſed Saints are, ſeems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the words of Chriſt to the Thief, <hi>Luke 23. 43. To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And as for the State they ſhall be in, it is deſcribed to be a better eſtate then here in the body, and that they ſhall be with Chriſt. See both <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. that is more nearly with him, and ſo in a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition, then while here in the body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. which ſhould make all the truly Godly willing to depart this life, and to be with Chriſt, although the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory are reſerved till after the Reſurrection and Judgment, yet at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this body, it will be much better.</p>
               <p>2. As for the place and ſtate of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">2. Of the Wicked.</note> as the Saints attain not the higheſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo the wicked go not into the place of
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:40486:278"/> the greateſt puniſhment; the reaſon (as to both) is, becauſe there is a judgment to come, and God doth not firſt execute, and then judge, but firſt judge, and then execute the ſentence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31. the moſt and beſt light I find in Scripture concerning this matter is, that there is a place where the ſpirits of wicked men are kept and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Lord as Priſoners, for the judgment, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 19. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>3. Concerning the Reſurrection, and in<note place="margin">3. Of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. All ſhall be raiſed.</note> this I ſhall premiſe ſix things. 1. Prove the truth thereof, and that it ſhall be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all both juſt and unjuſt, <hi>Act. 24. 15. And have hope towards God, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo allow, that there ſhall be a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, both of the just and unjust;</hi> and this our Lord confirms, <hi>John</hi> 5. 28, 29. and the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 12, &amp;c.</hi> where the Apoſtle diſputeth againſt thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this Doctrine, ſtating the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on ſuch plain and infallible grounds, as might tend to ſatisfie Conſcience in this matter, and to ſilence all gain-ſayers; and indeed this truth is ſtated both in the old and new Teſtament, and have been the Faith of all the Saints ſince the Fall, <hi>Job. 19. 25, 26. 27. Pſal. 49. 14. Iſaiah 26. 19. John 11. 24. Acts 26. 6, 7, 8. Heb.</hi> 11. 35.</p>
               <p>2. It ſhall be the ſame bodies that was<note place="margin">2. The ſame bodies.</note> laid down in the duſt, that ſhall be raiſed again, and not another body, for that would
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:40486:278"/> be no Reſurrection, but a Creation; the Reſurrection will be a work of greater power and wiſdom, then the Creation of other bodies. For God to bring up the ſame bodies through all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and impoſſibilities to reaſon and fleſh, will abundantly magnifie God in his whole name in the Reſtauration work, and Jeſus Chriſt by whom it ſhall be done, that it ſhall be the ſame bodies that ſhall be raiſed, See <hi>Iſa. 26. 19.

But that the time of the Lords coming is uncertain, as to man; I ſhall ſtate on theſe following grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

Having propheſied in the former part of the Chapter of the glorious reſtauration of the Church, which ſhall be accompliſhed at that day, with the deſtruction of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches enemies; ſaith, <hi>ver. 20. In the latter daies ye ſhall conſider it perfectly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles did not know the time,<note place="margin">2. To the Apoſtles.</note> though they believed, and taught the truth of the Doctrine, yet the time was hid from them, any otherwiſe than ſigns, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conjectures, as <hi>Paul, 2 Theſ. 2. 3.

               <p n="3">3. Angels knew it not, nor probably do<note place="margin">3. To An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</note> not know it, <hi>Matt. 24. 36. But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels of Heaven, but my Father only.</hi>

                  <hi>Acts 1. 7. It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> yet vain man would be wiſe above what is meet, forgetting that <hi>things revealed belong to us, and things ſecret belong to God:</hi> and indeed it's contrary to the Scripture, for any man to know certainly before hand, the hour, day, or year of our Lord's coming, then ſuch Scriptures as theſe could not be true, as <hi>Matt. 24. 44.

So that the time is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, that his people may be alwaies, in all generations ready prepared, and waiting for it. But let us take heed of fixing on times, in which all have, and probably muſt miſcarry. it is the way to deſtroy the Faith of the weak, in the thing it ſelf; and men loſe themſelves when they time things, kept ſecret in God; though good men hath failed herein, yet doubtleſs it hath riſen in part from pride, ſuppoſing they knew more than they did; but when it's apparent they miſs, there is cauſe to be humbled for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming above what they underſtood; yet,</p>
               <p>2. Though the time be uncertain, (and good reaſon it ſhould be ſo) yet we have grounds to believe and hope, that it is not far away, but may be (for all that we know) at the doors; for if Chriſt's firſt coming was in <hi>the end of the VVorld,</hi> Heb 9. 26. And
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:40486:287"/> if it was then but <hi>a little while before he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry,</hi> Ch. 10. 37.

               <p>3. The manner how he ſhall come, and<note place="margin">3. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Coming.</note> that will be wonderful, glorious, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; his firſt coming was meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he humbled himſelf, and was contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, trampled under feet of men, content to be abaſed, and vilified by ſinners, and bare all meekly, <hi>as a Lamb dumb before the ſhearers, ſo opened he not his mouth;</hi> and the reaſon of it was, becauſe he then came to ſave ſinners, <hi>to give his life a ranſome for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he then came not to condemn the VVorld, but to ſave the World;</hi> but now he will come to judge the World; and therefore he muſt come as the great Judge of the World, in Power and great Glory, to the dread, amazement and aſtoniſhment of the World; therefore he is deſcribed <hi>to come in flaming fire,</hi> to come with <hi>the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as for the Deceaſed Saints to loſe their glory in coming from Heaven to Reign on Earth, I anſwer, 1. That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Saints, though in a better place, and in a better condition then when in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet are not in their perfect glory, though free from ſin and affliction, for the ſpirit was fitted to and for he body, and is not in a capacity for the glory of the reſtored ſtate without the body; if it were, no need then of the Reſurrection, and the Apoſtle ſaith in vain, that <hi>we are of all men most miſerable, if the dead riſe not;</hi> by which our hope of a better life would be fruſtrate; and the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>the Souls of thoſe beheaded or ſlain for the testimony of Jeſus, cry for vengeance</hi> againſt thoſe that ſlew them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9, 10. which argueth they are not in ſuch a perfection of glory as is ſuppoſed.</p>

<pb n="577" facs="tcp:40486:299"/> of diminiſhing to their glory, but rather as a part of their glory, 1 Theſ. 4. 14. <hi>Thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It will be the Saints Glory to Reign with their Lord, and thoſe who believe it, look not on it as ſuch an unglorious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but triumph in it, as their great glory, <hi>That they ſhall Reign on Earth, Rev.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p>4. It will no whit derogate from their glory, when they ſhall have the glory of Heaven on Earth, the glorious preſence of Chriſt, and of Saints and Angels, Heaven upon the Earth ſhall be enjoyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>

So that they muſt be taken up to meet him, that they may come with him, and that it is not only their Spirits, but their bodies, raiſed and united to their ſpirits that muſt come with him is evident, 1 Theſ. 4. 14. <hi>Thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus</hi> will God bring with him; it is the

               <p>2. The Scripture tells us plainly of Chriſts coming down upon the Earth with his Saints, <hi>Joel 3. 11. Zec.</hi> 14. 4, 5. where is not only the truth aſſerted, but the place named. And thus much in anſwer to the Objections.</p>

                  </label> at and after the coming of the Lord from Heaven, my grounds for it are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the Prophets do foretell of ſuch things, and we are bound to believe the truth thereof, and neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles mentions any thing thereof, in the new Teſtament, but directs us to look for the coming of Chriſt, and to a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſuffering and waiting for that day, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Apoſtaſie, but not of deliverance; hence I conclude, that it muſt be done at and after his appearing, done it muſt be, the new Teſtament allows no place for it, before Chriſt cometh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be done at and after his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture States the time of the Reſtauration work ſpoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the conquering and bringing down of the Churches enemies, to be at one and the ſame time, where one is ſtated the other is ſtated likewiſe, and muſt be done together; for the fall of the enemies will be the Churches deliverance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. and 25, 26, 27. Chapters, and 66. 8, to 16. With multitudes of other Scriptures that I could mention: and its evident that the Reſtauration Work ſhall be at and after Chriſts coming from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. And therefore the
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:40486:305"/> bringing down of enemies ſhall be then.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe (probably) moſt of the things Propheſied of in the Revelation, from chap. 4. may and muſt be done at and after Chriſts coming from Heaven, my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſuch a ſuppoſition are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the time of <hi>Johns</hi> receiving of it, is called <hi>the Lords day, Rev.</hi> 1. 10. and very probably do relate to that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>John 21. 22, 23. If I will that he tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till I come, what is that to thee;</hi> Which might be this coming, called the <hi>Lords day,</hi> ſo called, becauſe Chriſt did in Viſion diſcover all things to <hi>John,</hi> as it ſhall be done over when he cometh, both in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of his enemies, and ſaving his people,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe very probably that the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seals, Sounding of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and pouring out of the Vials, may be all at and after Chriſts coming from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and if ſo, it muſt admit of time for the doing thereof, and muſt be the time of perfecting the Reſtauration work ſpoken of by the Prophets, in bringing down of the World, and ſaving of the Church.</p>
               <p>My Reaſons ſo to ſuppoſe are,</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the opening of the firſt Seal, chapter 6. 1. 2. ſeems to be the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Chriſt from Heaven, <hi>I ſaw and
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:40486:306"/> behold a white Horſe, and he that ſate upon him had a Bow, and a Crown was given unto him, and he went forth Conquering and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi> I cannot apprehend what ſhould be here intended, if not the coming of Chriſt from Heaven, and entering upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querring work; and ſo fulfilling the Scriptures of the Prophets, for he ſhall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill Scripture exactly in his ſecond coming, as he did in his firſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 18, 21, and the opening of the other Seals as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to ſhew the manner how he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
               <p>I know this Riding forth on the White Horſe, is underſtood to intend the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, and Chriſt Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls thereby to himſelf; but I ſee no ground at all for this Conception, and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the higheſt Conquering Work on this account, was by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the firſt publication thereof, and that is not it which is here intended, for chap. 4. 1. That voice that ſpake to <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will ſhew thee things that muſt be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi> Therefore it could not intend the firſt Conquering Work of the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not likely it ſhould intend any time ſince, that work having been ſinking ever ſince, and but weak at the beſt, compared with the Primitive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ower.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="591" facs="tcp:40486:306"/>2. Becauſe I do not find any Scripture to Concord with this, that might help to give us light in ſuch an underſtanding; that is, the Preaching of the Goſpel is no where held forth in a warlike way, but in a way of meekneſs to perſwade and win ſouls to the Lord; I know the Life of a Chriſtian is a ſpiritual warfare, and that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Weapons of our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not Carnal, but Spiritual, and mighty through God,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. But this in no caſe anſwers the warlike expreſſions of the Scripture in hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To underſtand this of Chriſts coming, to Conquer and bring down his enemies, do fully agree with other Scriptures in the very terms thereof, and why then we ſhould turn it in ſuch an Allegory, I know not; See the ſame expreſſions in ſubſtance, <hi>Rev,</hi> 19. 11.—Which I think is underſtood by all, to intend the ſecond and Glorious coming of Chriſt, and work which he will do at that day, and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. 3, 4, 5. to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110. 5, 6. which ſeems to clear the truth in this Scripture, and gives grounds to judge, that it is one and the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe there are other things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the opening of the other Seals, which (probably) muſt be done at and after Chriſts appearing, as at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:40486:307"/> of the ſixth Seal, chap. 6. 12. to the end, and chapter. 7. the Sealing of the Tribes, which is not yet done, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably will be done, till after Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and chapter 9. 1, 2, 3, 4. at the ſound of the fifth Trumpet, <hi>Locuſt, come forth, and had power as Scorpions;</hi> and was commanded to hurt none of the <hi>Sealed ones, but only thoſe men that had not the Seale of God in their Foreheads;</hi> which Sealed ones relates to the ſealing mentioned, chapter 7. 3, 4. to 9. Theſe Locuſts came forth after the Tribes was Sealed, and therefore after Chriſt comes from Heaven, and ſo do not intend any thing yet paſt, relating to Turk or Pope; for if the Servants of God, be not yet Sealed in their foreheads, then theſe Locuſts be not yet come forth. And further, there was never yet any wicked power that did only hurt the wicked, but their work hath been to hurt the ſervants of God, and chiefly to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, but theſe ſhall only hurt the wicked, but not touch the Sealed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, therefore ſome other (and further) thing is intended, then what hath been commonly underſtood.</p>
               <p>4. Becauſe the Pouring out of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven laſt Plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 15, 16. chapters, ſeems clear, not to be done, till at and after Chriſts appearing, chapter 14. 15, to 20. <hi>The Earth is Reaped, for the Harvest was fully ripe,</hi> verſe 15. <hi>And cast into the
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:40486:307"/> VVinepreſs of the wrath of God,</hi> verſe 19. 20. which holds forth the work of Chriſt when he comes, (as I think all muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) chapter 15. 1. <hi>The Angels have the ſeven laſt Plagues,</hi> for in them is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the wrath of God, that is, the wrath mentioned, chapter 14. 19. it being a Relative to it, ſo that Chapter 14. 19, 20. expreſſeth the worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>reaped, and caſt into the wine preſs of the wrath of God,</hi> chapter 15. 1.—The pouring out of the Vials ſhews the way of treading the Wine preſs, <hi>for in them is filled up the wrath of God;</hi> and is the ſame, as chapter 6. 1, to 8. and foretold by the Prophets, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 38. 17.—and <hi>Zep.</hi> 3. 8. by all which it ſeems to me, that the great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Conqueſt of enemies ſpoken of by the Prophets, is to be accompliſhed by the Lord, at and after his appearing.</p>
               <p>5. It is by the Prophets in plain terms expreſt to be done by Chriſt, as head Lord and chief in the work, <hi>Pſal. 110. 5, 6. The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike through Kings in the day of his wrath, he ſhall judge am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng the Heathen, he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies, he ſhall wound the heads over many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 1, to 6. Now if this be ſo, there muſt be time for this work, after Chriſts appearing, to
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:40486:308"/> the beginning of the thouſand years Reign.</p>
               <p>6. If the Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> be not till Chriſts appearing from Heaven, nor the gathering of the Jews from their diſperſion till then, then this work may and muſt be done then, and we have very probable grounds for both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Babylons</hi> Fall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 17, 18, 19. at the pouring forth of the ſeventh Vial, <hi>great Babylons Name is in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the wine of the fierceneſs of his wrath;</hi> and chapter. 19, 19. the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are in their power againſt him that ſate upon the Horſe; That is, the Lord Chriſt; and I think all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber judgments do underſtand both of theſe Scriptures to relate to the day of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as for the Jews being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from their diſperſion and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, in as much as it is by ſome not only queſtioned but denyed. I ſhall make that to be the tenth and laſt queſtion, in which I ſhall give ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable grounds both for the thing and time.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether there be any grounds from Scripture to expect that the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be gathered from their diſperſion, and ſavingly

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That they ſhall be gathered in, and have their part in this glory, is to me without all queſtion; my grounds are,</p>

From the many Propheſies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thereof in the Old Teſtament, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 10, to 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 27. to the end, and 32. 37, to 42. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. to 38. with multitudes of other Scriptures to the ſame purpoſe, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this reſtored eſtate runs firſt and chiefly to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 5, 6. and 33. 15, 16. and the believing Gentiles come in by Grace, to be intereſted in their promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> It is true, the promiſes run to them, but it is on the new Covenant account, and ſo to all believers both Jew and Gentile, for they are by nature all alike under ſin, and the Goſpel knows no difference; and as for the promiſes to the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready performed to them in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, many thouſand of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and lived under the Government of Chriſt their King; and <hi>James</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth his Epiſtle to the <hi>Twelve Tribes ſcattered,</hi> &amp;c. By which it appears, that the 12 Tribes believed and owned the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <pb n="596" facs="tcp:40486:309"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its granted that the glory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a new Covenant Grace and Glory, and that by nature only they ſhall obtain no more then the Gentiles; yet it is as true that God deſigned Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Grace to multitudes of <hi>Abrahams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed, though not on the account of nature only, or alone, becauſe they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed by nature, but as in Chriſt Jeſus; in the Covenant of Grace and Converſion to God in the Covenant, for without the birth from above nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jew nor Gentile may expect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom, God will do this work for them, <hi>but not by their Covenant, Ezek.</hi> 16. 61. but by his new Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The beginning work of Grace ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected on ſome of them in the Primitive times, was not the whole fulfilling of the promiſes relating to that people in the Scriptures mentioned, and multitudes of others of like import, that might be mentioned, not only in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but in the new, by which its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that God intended that very people, and deſigned to do them good in the latter end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. 15, 25, 26. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That blindneſs is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto them in part,</hi> and that but <hi>for a time, and then all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ver. 32.

               <p>And as for the Twelve Tribes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>James.</hi> 1. 1. its evident that the ten Tribes carryed away by <hi>Salmaneſer, 2 Kings</hi> 17. never returned. For 1. we read not of their returns. 2. They came not into their own Land, for that was poſſeſt till the days of Chriſt, by thoſe people ſent by <hi>Salmaneſer</hi> to poſſeſs it, and they were a people with whom the Jews had no fellowſhip, nor would Chriſt permit his Diſciples to go among them. 3. Its a received truth (by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) among the Jews, that they never returned, neither is it certainly known where they are; and as for <hi>James</hi> he might well write to the twelve Tribes, for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt underſtand that he writ not to the Tribes in general, but to thoſe that did, or after might believe and own the Lord Jeſus out of all the Tribes, which (comparatively) were but few.</p>

<pb n="603" facs="tcp:40486:312"/> works of Piety or works of Charity, ſuch as do immediately relate to God, his Worſhip and Service, or ſuch as relate to men, to body or ſoul, and ſuch as ought to be performed in the whole courſe of the converſation, they may be all counted works of piety, for they are ſuch as God requireth, and they ought to be done all in obedience to the Lord, <hi>And in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Glory of God the Father through him,</hi> and the good of our neighbour, and God will reward the faithful and ſincere works of his people at that day, <hi>Matt. 25. 34, 35. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 17, 18, 19. its that without which our Faith is dead, and none of the Faith of the Goſpel; ſo that good works are honourable unto God, <hi>John 15. 8.

               <p n="2">2. Be much in the expectation and looking for this bleſſed Hope: O look for, and love his appearing, which you can never rightly do if unprepared for it; therefore be ye always ready, that ſo ye may deſire it, it is to them <hi>that look for him, that he will appear a ſecond time without ſin to Salvation, Heb.</hi> 9. 28. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo live before him, and to him, that

               <p>Thus, if Saints were Conſious and Faithful, in their ſincere, humble, and univerſal walk with God, hear accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of his Grace, they might <hi>be able to meditate terrour in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Land that ſeems to be afar off,</hi> Iſa. 33. 17, 18.
